0,"Broad strokes about student life, not really about the freshman year","I expected this book to be about the freshman year experience, based on the title and the way that the book began. However, the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life. The author did not live in a freshman residence hall and I am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not. Memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college (cut corners) as a stragegy to manage their time.","Broad strokes about student life, not really about the freshman year.

1,50's Sci Fi at it's Best!,"This is a classic 1950's film. A spaceship lands at night and only a young boy knows what is really going on. The special effects may not be up to par with modern films but it is a fun and exciting film that the whole family can enjoy.

1,Wonderful Story,"What a great way to introduce children to all the world's religions. Well, at least some of them.

You can extend that down a few years as a read-to book. Marvelous book.","Wonderful Story. What a great way to introduce children to all the world's religions. Well, at least some of them.

1,Socratic approach to OOP and design patterns,"Caveat: I have taken several classes from Dr. Felleisen and enjoy his pedagogical approach.The book follows the philosophical Q&A format popularized by Socrates such that the reader is visually presented with questions on the left-hand side of the page and answers on the right-hand size of the page. One is expected and encouraged to actively participate in the book's pseudo-dialogue.While some experienced programmers and novices who are pressed for time in their work and studies may decry the lack of a ""straightforward"" presentation: that is precisely what this book intends to avoid. A desire to improve & expand one's thinking processes in the context of programming are all that is required for enjoying and benefiting from this book.Excellent for undergrad OO programming classes.","Socratic approach to OOP and design patterns.

0,"Great bracket, junk strap","These brackets are nicely finished and easy to adjust and use. The included straps have a really nice padded surround on the buckle, but the buckle itself is totally unsafe.

Also all the books that I've ever read about ""druid magic, techniques, shamanism etc...I have found to be worthless and just a dressed up version of wicca.

1,Could be a great educational experience,"This is a good little item. We put it together and it worked like a charm.

As I took the tree out of the box I noticed a significant amount of leaf-loss, but it was so full of leaves I figured this was normal. Over the next week about 75% of the leaves fell off despite proper watering, humidity, and sun. The company sent me a replacement tree which arrived all but dead. I now believe that both trees experienced shock being transported in the cold weather. I was able to save the first tree they sent me but I would advise agains ordering in the cold weather months or paying for expedited shipping.","Get Your Green Thumb Ready.

0,Didn't get cover art on my Kindle,"I enjoyed reading the book, but I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the cover art when I purchased this book for my Kindle. It was light buying the new book at a book store, but before the cashier gave me my book had ripped off the cover, yet charged me full price for the damaged book. It's like the publisher didn't bother to include the cover image and didn't care whether readers wanted the cover image or not, since it's a digitatl copy of the book. Not having the cover reduced my enjoyment of the book.","Didn't get cover art on my Kindle.

1,For once it's not predictable,"As an avid reader of Ms. Steele, The Ghost really gets you involved with the characters. Weaving in and out of two peoples lives in two different time periods makes it interesting and makes you wonder how will it really end. Almost all of Ms. Steel's books are predictable. With this one you can't be too sure. Does keep you guessing, until you reach about 3/4 into the book.","For once it's not predictable.

1,Everything I could have asked for!,"I did a lot of research on this product before making my purchase. I felt like Amazon was very thorough in their description of the Kindle. The videos are very insightful and probably are the best selling tool of the product since it shows in detail how the Kindle works. I have told my friends, as well as strangers who have seen me using the Kindle how much I have enjoyed it in a very short period of time. Sometimes I shy away from technology assuming it will be too hard to learn, but since I have begun reading so much and purchasing so many books I really felt this product was for me. I was not disappointed. The Kindle is effortless to use and I am still amazed every time I purchase a book that it usually arrives to my Kindle in about 10 seconds. Thank you for making the joy of reading so much more pleasurable and convenient. A big plus....it is much easier to pet my dog and read at the same time since I can hold the Kindle with one hand.

0,"A stilted, vapid effort. Very disappointing.","After hearing the terrific songs ""So Unsexy"" and ""Hands Clean"" on the radio, I rushed out and bought what I hoped would be a smart, energetic, insightful CD. What I discovered instead was Alanis Morrissette basically recycling the same music she used on her ""Jagged Little Pill"" CD. Only this time, her lyrics are more obtuse, less accessible, and less compelling. There are a few bright spots on the CD, such as the songs I mentioned. But, overall, the CD is rather negligible and self-involved. I believe only die-hard fans of Morrissette's will get any real mileage out of this vapid collection. (Ironically enough, I purchased Lisa Loeb's new CD ""Cake & Pie"" the same day I bought this one, and that CD surprised me by being the musically superior to Morrissette's effort. So if you want some great new chick rock, check out that title.)","A stilted, vapid effort. Very disappointing..

0,"Much, much worse than any other Shrek movie","It's as if the movie was done by weird, immature teenagers. Honestly. The jokes are either cruel and just not funny. The plot is lame, dumb, and flat. The story happens in just, hmm, three places. The new characters feel flat, the original characters now feel flat also. Well, I can honestly say that neither parents nor children (at least those with a slightly sophisticated sense of humor) will be entertained by this.","Much, much worse than any other Shrek movie.

1,I think I've met this woman!,"From the start of the book, I felt like I knew Charlene. I loved her simpleness, her relationship with her family, and mostly I loved her ability to keep things going for her children. She was able to admit to being totally confused and at the same time she managed to figure out who she was. I loved all the characters in the book, even the ornery ones turned out to be good people. Charlene's father was so well written, I could see him in my mind and hear his voice.He is a character I will long remember. This was a book full of love and laughter,and a book that is simply the story of the lives of those living in a small community who stick together when they need to. I throughly enjoyed it as an entertaining book that shows humanity at it's best. I definitly recommend it to anyone who reads for the pure pleasure of it.","I think I've met this woman!.

0,Awful!!,This is a movie where you wait for something to happen and nothing ever does! What's worse is that the ending did not resolve the story. Bill Murray as a kind of loser who receives an unsigned note from an old girlfriend claiming that he is the father of her child. Murray seeks out 4 old girlfriends to find out who might have sent it. The director tries to be cute by having the daughter of one of the women (named Lolita of course) walk around naked in front of him. This was supposed to be the comedy in this film? This movie lacks any real humor and should be avoided at all costs.,Awful!!. This is a movie where you wait for something to happen and nothing ever does!

So if you go out thinking that you are getting a good deal for 3D animation/drawing tools, you are way off. All in all, on a scale from one to five, I give it a negative five, but that was not a choice in the ratings so I had to pick one.

1,Tolerable,I have a small dog and after the recent teeth cleaning by our vet to the tune of $400 I figured any attempt to clean teeth would be better than nothing. I've always brushed my dogs teeth so I was disappointed that I wasn't doing enough to keep the tarter at bay. This oral rinse is very different and a bit challenging to use at first. My dog wasn't too keen on the long plastic tube and I've figured out that it's best to have the liquid nearly to the tip of the tube before inserting it in my dogs mouth. If I don't have the liquid in the tube the amount of air blowing in my dogs mouth leads her to shy away from it. All it takes is a quick squeeze on either side of the dogs mouth and you're done! My dog doesn't seem to be bothered by the taste if there is one. Overall I'm hoping that this well help keep my dogs teeth cleaner but I won't really know until next year.,Tolerable.

Still, whether recording under his name or as Palace Brother, Bonnie ""prince"" billy, etc... the quality of his output remains unchanged and unmatched if you like this sort of music (the kind of music artists such as Smog and Nick cave play). It's a country-esque, folky, brand of rock, terribly slow and mournful. The lyrics mostly deal with gloomy subjects such as love (its darker side), sin and mixed forms of sadness. Shortly put, it's not the kind of record you'll play at a party.

1,Should've released it as the complete second season,The first season of this show was where it started. The sceond season was when it started to get reall good. All of these episodes are good but i'm kinda getting bored with Badda-Bing Badda-Boom. Tabitha is a good charcter and she comes back to the institute in the third season. She leaves the brotherhood house when Mystique came back. She wasn't happy to learn that Avalanche had tried to join the X-men but she soon straightens them out. Power Surge focuses on Jean and her teleapthy problem. The team helps her get under control soon. This is a great bunch of episodes and i'm sad that the series was cancelled.

To Be Frank features a mature, guitar oriented style that confidently demonstrates Nik's great musical abilities. Also featured are Nik's usual complex and thought provoking lyrics. There are several cuts worth consideration as radio releases (are you listening all you spin doctors out there). A great CD from a great musician!

1,"""Wait Till Helen Comes""","The book ""Wait Till Helen Comes"" written by Mary Downing Hahn was a great book. It was very exciting. I didn't want to stop reading it because it was so good.

0,Sad Ending To A Great Career,"I can't help but agree with the other reviewers that say that this CD is nothing more than a crass commercial ploy by Buffett to get his hands on some of that Country Music scene money and is, in a word, crap. I also admit that Liz O'Connor and Bill Jabanoski's CDs are much better than anything Jimmy has done in years and years. However, they are both much younger performers with fresh ideas and Jimmy was even better then them when he was their age. It's just another case of the changing of the guard. Yes Jimmy, it is time to stop making a fool out of yourself and head out to pasture, but thanks for all the great music and memories.","Sad Ending To A Great Career.

0,Disappointing,"Being an American classic, we decided to purchase this product. Unfortunately, we find it to be a terrible product. Although 2 children can comfortably sit, that's as far the use goes. The handle being very rigid, the wagon won't go under the boot of a car, so you can forget about taking it to a nearby park for a stroll. We stay upstairs, and its quite heavy to it lift it over the stairs. So we use it mostly inside home. Also, the plastics are cheaply made.Frankly, I am not sure how this company lasted for 100 years. I would have assumed a 100-year-old company to have addressed these basic usability issues. What a waste of space in our home.","Disappointing.

1,Bryson Again Travels to Successville with his The Lost Continent,"Thematic and organizational similarities to Steinbeck's Travels With Charley and William Least Heat Moon's Blue Highways are obvious, but Bryson takes The Lost Continent into territory scarcely traveled by Steinbeck and Least Heat Moon. You see, Bryson laces humor liberally throughout his travel memoirs. The other writers' travelogues about adventures and people encountered on American roadways had less humor. That's not to say that Bryson's book surpasses those of the great, earlier writers in this genre; Bryson's approach is merely true to Bryson's chuckle-packed narrative style. Therefore, since I find Bryson's humor and storytelling so irresistible, I feel this book is a great read.","Bryson Again Travels to Successville with his The Lost Continent.

1,Easy to use classic,"The iron is performing well in its role, and is very easy to use from the control standpoint. Some of my staff mention that it is a bit heavier than the modern design counterparts. They also mention that they like the clear plastic reservoirs of the more modern units as they can see the water level. However the iron appears to be well constructed and very sturdy. Time will tell if it holds up to leaking reservoirs, stained sole plates and worn out heating units of many of the other brands that we have used over the past years. From a price perspective it was a very good deal.","Easy to use classic. The iron is performing well in its role, and is very easy to use from the control standpoint.

0,Don't Bother!,"This book was AWFUL. The worst part is that I hung in there until the very end, for some reason thinking that it would pull together into a good story. But it was a bad joke, and poorly written at that.

The characters were poorly developed and unlikable. The references to mIRC and ""haXXors"" were just plain STUPID. I could perhaps see the story appealing to a preteen, but there's too much inappropriate X-rated trash in this book for that to be a good thing.","Don't Bother!. This book was AWFUL.

However, I am not familiar with the rest of his discography for a simple reason; I only buy discs which are acclaimed critically. Yet, modest as Kissin's reputation is among reviewers, this performance truly shocked me. It really was THAT bad."

1,Redemption and Hope,"I thought this family movie was really good. It is basically about an older woman of faith reaching out to a teenager in trouble. Her gentle compassion touches and changes him. I thought all the actors and actresses were perfectly cast - they all did a wonderful job. Aside from a few cuss words (which she gently discourages), this is a great movie for families and children. I would recommend it to anyone.","Redemption and Hope. I thought this family movie was really good. It is basically about an older woman of faith reaching out to a teenager in trouble.

1,A Classical Christmas,"I bought this cd several years ago and for one reason or another, it set on the shelf untouched till now. Well, I finally pulled it down and listened to both cd's. It is a wonderful colection of classical Christmas music performed by great artists, musicians and vocalists. There is a good mix of traditional and symphonic music included. The titles I most enjoyed are those performed by the Kings Choir at Cambridge. Be asured, those beautiful treble voices will push your sound system to it's upper limits!

0,No-Link Toslink,I purchased this so-called digital audio splitter to allow non-simultaneous audio connection between my Blue-Ray DVD Player and my new 3rd generation Apple TV with my older but high-end Onkyo TX-DS747 Audio Video Control Receiver that unfortunately has only one digital optical input. I have great sound with either connected alone to the Onkyo but have difficulty switching the cables when changing video sources. Too many cables and cabinetry prevent easy access. So I hoped with reservations (due to the significant poor reviews) that maybe I would be lucky and this splitter would solve my selection problem. It just doesn't work. No sound from either source. This wan't a costly mistake but a disappointing result and waste of time.

However, today when I tried to install the color #33 cart., the printer tells me that it is the ""incorrect cartridge"". It looks identical to the one in the printer (that works) but it does not.

1,Sun Tzu was right.,"This is a better book than I first thought it was. On re-reading it, I realized that Collins was actually restating the principles set forth in Sun Tzu's Art of War: The devil really is in the details - those who tend to be successful are those who have the best understanding of the business at hand and have the courage to do what it takes to get the job done right.This book may be destined to be a classic, but it only builds on a tradition of applying rational principles to unravel what appears to be complex situations. It doesn't break new ground. Collins is not a Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Smith, Riccardo, Samuelson or Friedman, but he does a good job of showing how new challenges can be met by the application of intelligence and hard work.","Sun Tzu was right..

0,It's not worth buying this one by itself,"This is easily the worst of the 20 episodes in this series; to begin with, it doesn't contain any newsreel footage as the name implies, and by ""early years"" it goes back to 1914. The first sections of this episode consist of footage of World War I with some sound dubbed in and a very boring and superficial commentary by the narrator of this series. We then get large chunks of a post-WW II documentary on the Nazis to explain the chaos of Weimar Germany and what led to Hitler's seizure of power. We then progress to edited sections of ""Triumph of the Will,"" and that's basically it. Even the edits from the latter film were chosen badly, as they could've selected some of those that showed the brutal force that lay at the heart of Nazism but didn't (the marchpast of the SS in Nuremberg at the end of the film, for example). I would only buy this episode if you were buying the set of the first five episodes, otherwise, it's not worth the money.","It's not worth buying this one by itself.

1,Comfortable for long trips. Perfect for Kayaking!,"We bought our first Kayak here a while ago. At first we tried using a boating life vest we had from when we had a boat. It was ok, but had thick back to it and the sides were thick too. I suppose if your screaming across the water you may need all that extra flotation to keep you up. When I saw this vest here I had to try it out. When we got it it was immediately clear that it was designed for a rower in mind. The front is ample.The sides are open pretty wide and allow for rowing. While in the kayak the sides of the vest allow for you to sit back comfortably and not be forced into an uncomfortable paddling position.Construction quality is fantastic. I think this should last us for years. Don't skimp on safety equipment. Pay a little more and know you will be safe having a great time skimming on the water.If you have a kayak and need a new vest, this one is highly recommended!","Comfortable for long trips.

0,My head hurt worse than when I ACTUALLY dropped acid...,"This is a surprising piece of work. Tom Wolfe writes most of the book seemingly from the view of the Merry Pranksters. However, his tone seems to become distanced and coldly objective as the book concludes. Ultimatly the reader may (if not deluded into thinking the lifestyle a virtual utopia) see flaws and ultimate failure of the lifestyle. I did not find the Merry Pranksters amusing, free, or admirable. I found much of their behaviour to be mindlessly hedonistic, self-destructive, and generally sheep-like in following the teachings of a raving loon. By the end of the book, I had a throbbing headache. However, I think the problem lies not in the writing of Tom Wolfe (for I enjoyed his other books tremendously) but in the subject matter. In conclusion, I am surprised that the scrambled, self-indulgent mind of Ken Kesey was capable of conceiving such a brilliant book as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""","My head hurt worse than when I ACTUALLY dropped acid....

""Malka a primitive planet, its habitants very similar to those on earth, where two clans of Barbarian [sic] warriors fight for supremacy; but it is this fight that threatens to eradicate this race of beings."" The hero introduces himself to the heroine as follows: ""I am Niro and I mean you know [sic] harm,"" he said [sic] his voice deep and velvety. The misuse of such basics of 'too' and 'to' and 'know' and 'know, the failure to use the most basic commas, and the complete disregard of the proper verb tense are constant throughout.

1,AWESEOME CD!!!!!!!!! LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!,"This is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to. Matchbox 20 is great and this CD shows how they started out. The opening song, Real World is my favorite on the whole CD. The second song, Long Day is another classic while 3 a.m. is interesting along with the video for it. I don't like much of the songs after it though. After Back 2 Good they just songs that are single-titled with one word. Damn, Kordy, Busted, Shame, and Hame are my least favorite songs. Other then that I love this CD. Their second album is Mad Seasoon.","AWESEOME CD!!!!!!!!! LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!. This is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to.

0,No more Moby...Please!,"Well what can I say, Moby has done it again. He has successfully produced a terrible cd that almost gives electronic music a bad name. The question is, when will people quit wasting their money on his albums? When that day comes, maybe Moby will hang it up and quit polluting the airwaves with garbage. The only thing Moby is good at is whining and complaining about the decent music being relaesed. (No, don't stand up so fast Slim Shady, I'm not talking about you) According to Moby, we are all made of stars. Well at least his video was. Maybe I'm not giving ""18"" enough credit. It does sound good while being ejected from a cd player and thrown from a moving car. Lets all do the music industry a favor and buy cds that are actually worth listening to. Then we might not have to worry about more noise pollution from Moby and other MTV darlings that don't deserve a record deal in the first place.","No more Moby...Please!.

0,I'd give it zero stars if that was an option,"I owned 2 of these units in the space of 6 months. When the first one had problems after a few months, I assumed I had just overworked it or gotten water into something vital. The second unit didn't last 2 months before it started doing the same thing the first one did (the 'on' light flashing not allowing a reset without unplugging and reconnecting the unit). I went to HB's web site and e-mailed customer service a thorough description of the problem. I NEVER received an e-mail response. I did receive a packet of coffeemaker de-scaler in the mail with no accompanying correspondence. Believe me when I say, as a coffee maker/drinker for over 45 years, I KNOW when a coffeemaker needs de-scaling and can handle that without help. That will be my last Hamilton Beach appliance due to a total lack of customer service.","I'd give it zero stars if that was an option. I owned 2 of these units in the space of 6 months.

1,"A ""can't put it down"" read","Thinking this would be ""cozy"" type mystery, I settled down for a light evening read of ""Unruly Passions"". I was surprised and delighted to discover a sensitively drawn portrayal of a variety of characters, all of whom were multi-dimensional. At times, the reader can play with books as if they contain blocks instead of characters, interchanging them at will since they are lacklustre. Not so here. Ms. Charles has a village, the Vicar and his wife, the female Archdeacon and her husband and the village newcomer: wealthy potboiler writer and femme fatale. Anything anticipated as deja vu from this seemingly banal mixture will be totally different from the reader's expectation. As carefully as a microsurgeon's delvings, the writer delicately examines in surprising fashion the reverberations of passions which become unruly. There is a mystery twist, but it rides tandem with the denouement and resolution of the story. Sorry when the last page had to be turned.","A ""can't put it down"" read.

1,Fantastic,"This book is fantastic, challenging, direct, short, and easy to read daily - a great nugget to provoke my thinking and my life every day. More than summarizing or expounding on a Scriptural passage or theme, Bonhoeffer's writings pierce the heart and unsettle our preconceived notions and comfortable lifestyle. Very worthwhile for my own self-evaluation as well as to stimulate discussion or thoughts to share with others.","Fantastic.

1,Great for occasional use,"As the owner of a 1995 Miata I am forever tweaking, repairing and adding to the electrical system. I have used a non ratchet type crimp tool for a number of years, and its finally seized up on me. (Nothing to do with my leaving it on the drive in the rain and the parking on top of it. Oh no. Ahem.) So thought I'd treat myself to a replacement, and although unbranded, these ones were $14.99 on special offer, so thought I'd give them a go. And I can safely say they are pretty damn good - ratchet has a nice action, and they have a decent weight to them. But! Unlike my original crimp tool, which had nice rubber grips, this pair have harder plastic grips, which gave me a couple of nice blisters after a mega crimping session. So that's why they get just 4 stars - if you have tough man hands then you'll probably be fine!","Great for occasional use.

1,A Ska Revivalist Masterpiece,"It's hard to believe that Philly ska/reggae legends Ruder Than You released their debut ""Big Step"" on Moon SKA Records all the back in 1992.While it took a few live renditions of the songs to fully appreciate it, Big Step is a ska revivalist masterpiece. Pulling influences from all waves of ska, reggae, and even some funk thrown in here and there, I honestly haven't been able to stop listening lately (especially to ""Swallow Blood"", what a damn catchy song!)For some reason, Ruder Than You never gained the same popularity of other contemporaries such as The Slackers or The Pietasters even though they've toured and opened for The Skatalites, Bad Manners, and even Desmond Dekker. ""Big Step"" is one of their strongest releases, and should definitely be part of any ska fan's collection.[...]","A Ska Revivalist Masterpiece.

1,The Professional Amateur,"At least he is CIA intel and that is actually a big part of spying. The fact he wasn't part of the gun set doesn't make him less a spy. The story however wants you to think of him as a helpless bookworm. John Savage does one of the best roles of his career as a CIA agent that has been relegated to desk duty research which is his forte. When his fiance is killed overseas by ruthless terrorist he wants justice. With the help of his abilities he is able to formulate a plan and apply pressure in a way the CIA can't refuse. Good acting, directing, camera work, and music. Good action and great locations. A very entertaining movie that has been far overdue getting to DVD. Fans of spy movies should enjoy it and many that like action movies as well. Just as in the real world of espionage, all the loose ends aren't always tied in nice little knots. Fans of Tom Clancy will probably enjoy this one.","The Professional Amateur. At least he is CIA intel and that is actually a big part of spying.

1,"Pretty good, but she needs to lose the rap collaborations...","Goapele's CD kind of reminded me of Jill Scott's first CD. Good jazzy and bluesy grooves that sound plain old good! Songs such as ""Closer"", ""Too much the same"" and ""Things don't exist"" are really standout tracks. There are a few other good ones as well. However, when it comes to tracks like #2, called ""ease your mind"". Which isn't actually all that bad, it just wastes her talent as a singer to sing on a rap track. Some people can get away with it, but her voice is too good to waste with rap. Don't get me wrong I like some Hip-Hop, but she should stick to doing it all by herself. Maybe the Hieroglyphics found her and decided that they had to be a part of the CD. I don't know, but she should definitely be alone on her next release. She has a very wide range with her voice and it sounds beautiful. She definitely has the makings of being an outstanding artist.","Pretty good, but she needs to lose the rap collaborations....

1,Great when combined with other types of exercise,"You are meant to do one of these workouts every day for 30 days, stepping it up a level when you feel strong enough. I am not sure who could do these workouts every day without blowing out their knees, despite Gillian's constant promises that you don't have to lunge/squat all the way to get results. After 2 weeks, I realized that my drive to get fit again would backfire if I continued to do this every day.So instead I do a shred workout 3-4 times a week and walk or walk/jog 2-3 times per week, giving myself 1-2 recovery days a week.This combination has been phenomenal. I feel a million times stronger, especially in my core muscles. Jogging uphill has become almost enjoyable (almost), if only because I can't believe how strong my legs have become.I definitely recommend this as a complement to another type of exercise, but I would never recommend doing these workouts every day.","Great when combined with other types of exercise.

After 2 weeks, I realized that my drive to get fit again would backfire if I continued to do this every day.So instead I do a shred workout 3-4 times a week and walk or walk/jog 2-3 times per week, giving myself 1-2 recovery days a week.This combination has been phenomenal. I feel a million times stronger, especially in my core muscles. Jogging uphill has become almost enjoyable (almost), if only because I can't believe how strong my legs have become.I definitely recommend this as a complement to another type of exercise, but I would never recommend doing these workouts every day."
1,thank Amazon.com for Prince,"Explored so many other websites that claim to stock this DVD and never came up with the goods for a decent price.This is one of life's greatest ever music videos, and really does make Michael Jackson look like a wus in comparism.The quality on DVD is good, with only minimal hiss which you can only expect. It could have done with decent extras though, and only includes pics.","thank Amazon.com for Prince.

1,Excellent source for families of those battling bipolar do,"This wonderful book has helped my mother and I understand what our loved-one has gone through and suffered with. It is a well-written, easy to follow book that many will benefit from. The sections written by Melissa Olsen are extremely insighful and should be read by those with loved ones suffering with bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses. Bob Olsen's story is inspiring and this book should be read by those touched in any way by bipolar disorder.","Excellent source for families of those battling bipolar do.

1,A great processor if you get it at a good price.,"This is a solid processor for any socket 775 mainboard. I ran it in my primary PC for years on WinXP and then on Win7 until I decided to upgrade to a 64bit Win7 system and wanted more then the 4GB (3.5GB really) that 32bit OS allows. That was when I upgraded to a new mobo, processor, RAM, video card, the works. It really got the job done so I can personally recommend it for WinXP and Win7 casual users even today. It is not what you want for new PC gaming but if you do the usually surfing, check Email, and such it does a great job with todays common software.","A great processor if you get it at a good price..

1,Essential Laura Nyro.,"To Laura Nyro fans, all her albums are essential. WALK THE DOG & LIGHT THE LIGHT is no exception. It's perhaps the most essential of her post-SMILE studio albums, as it's the final one of her career, not counting the 2-disc STONED SOUL PICNIC collection. Some of Laura's most soulful vocals and songwriting are here, on tracks like ""A Woman of the World"" and ""Art of Love"". ""Louise Chuch"", Laura's rollicking tribute to women artists, is another highlight. And the closing track, a cover of ""Dedicated to the One I Love"", has to be counted among the most beautifully sung performances of her career. It demonstrates how much Laura had grown as a singer and interpreter since her whole album of covers, GONNA TAKE A MIRACLE, was released two decades earlier. A fine farewell effort from an artist who never received her due during her lifetime.","Essential Laura Nyro.. To Laura Nyro fans, all her albums are essential.

1,Performance with a deep thought,"At first hearing, it was not as capivating as her performance of Beethoven's No.3 & 4, which was preceedently issued. But as I put this CD on my player, it gets fascinating. She puts a lot of implications and meanings on every note, but it is not air-tight as her Schubert. Her plaing at Cadenza is, again, just awesome. I prefer this to Argerich's recording on DG. Strongly recommended.","Performance with a deep thought.

I have read lots of books about specific programming languages but I never felt like I understood how to program until I read this book.This book is great because it explains the fundamentals of programming in a way that makes it easy to learn any other language.

I hope to get back to the book one day and plow through it because Dandridge has always fascinated me but I'm not making any promises.

0,Misses the Mark,"I was expecting to hear some extremely original and great music, but this definitely misses the mark. This is an artist trying to sound like other artists, SRV, John Mellencamp, etc. If you were to hear this music you would know its wasn't the artists he is trying to sound like, and probably wouldn't want to hear repeatedly. His voice is fairly weak and indistinct and his guitar is so muddied it is hard to tell what he is trying to achieve. He might be fun to see at your local pub on a Saturday night, but if you like good rock and good blues, buy something by SRV, Eric Clapton, or Gary Moore. I thought this was going to be a revelation, but the only thing it revealed; listen to Johnny Lang for better vocals, guitar, and arrangements; for a young up and comer. This CD is going back to the store for an exchange or trade, but it won't be spinning in the player.","Misses the Mark.

1,Great Women's Bible Study,"Elizabeth George is a great Bible study author. She helps you dig in to see what the Scripture really says, and asks great questions to make you think about your own life. She also challenges you to live out and apply the Book of James to everyday life. The homework may seem a little repetitious in some of the questions, but it does help to emphasize a central truth or point. The homework does not take a long time which is great for women who are on the go, or who don't have a lot of time to devote to doing the lessons (it also helps that the Scripture portions are included in each lesson so you can make notes by the Scriptures or do the lessons without having to use your Bible). I would really recommend this study, and others by Elizabeth George.","Great Women's Bible Study. Elizabeth George is a great Bible study author.

1,A useful product,"I bought a stove top smoker a few years ago and although I do not use it everyday, I do tend to use it quite often. The problem is that I cannot find the fine wood chips at the regular stores like Wal-mart or Target. These store usually have the really large chips or blocks but not the fine dust like chips one needs for this type of smoker. I have looked at other online stores and found the chips but they were more expensive than at Amazon. What I also like is that this particular pack of chips has an assortment for using with various different meats such as for smoking fish, pork chops, etc. Also, since the smoker I have is a Cameron brand, this is perfect. I especially like the alder for Salmon.","A useful product. I bought a stove top smoker a few years ago and although I do not use it everyday, I do tend to use it quite often.

1,Perhaps the Best Trek Movie,"Definitely one of the best ""re-imaginings"" of a past series of movies, Abrams got everything right in this movie. There is enough Trek Cannon there to satisfy fans of the originals and enough that is different and fresh and new to entertain non-Trek fans. The casting by April Webster is brilliant...Zachary Quinto as Spock is almost eerie and Karl Urban as Bones is brilliant and Chris Pine brings a freshness to Kirk. Throw in the utterly appealing Zoey Saldana, an interesting twist with Spock and the amazingly appealing John Cho, and you got a stellar cast.I was expecting very little from this movie and I walked away remembering why I had always liked the original Trek so very much. I can't wait to see where the series goes from here.","Perhaps the Best Trek Movie. Definitely one of the best ""re-imaginings"" of a past series of movies, Abrams got everything right in this movie.

0,Not a good design,"The iRock's sound quality is on par for most of these FM transmitters, they all sound bad. I was aware of the sound limitations when I bought the iRock, my big issue is the design and placement of the power button. It is set up in such a way if you put it in your glove box (or just about anywhere) you can guarantee something will press the power button and run down the batteries. Very frustrating. The iRock also limits you to only four station radio choices, 88.1, 88.3 etc. Since I live in Boston, a fairly large city with many, many colleges, those frequency are being used. So the iRock is useless for me when I am downtown. As soon as I get out of the city I'm fine. There has to be a better unit out there.","Not a good design.

1,Great Biography of a Great Man,"I truly believe that Winston Churchill should have been named Time magazine's Man of the Century. No other person in the 20th century affected the lives of so many. Author Manchester has attempted a three volume biography (volume 2 ends at the start of World War II and volume 3 has not yet been published), which succeeds magnificently. The author brings Churchill alive, and like any great man, he is also flawed, and these are presented without apology. Manchester's style of writing and organization is superb. The story of Churchill's youth and young adulthood is thoroughly explored. The author puts special emphasis on Churchill's childhood and the effects of his relationship with his parents which became obvious throughout his life.I would recommend this book highly.","Great Biography of a Great Man.

1,A game changer,"This thing is awesome. I was at a french restaurant last year and they served a piece of salmon on a bed of thinly julienned zucchini and yellow zucchini and I've never been able to forget it. I'm one who believes in the proportions of food having a significant and sometimes dramatic effect on the taste. So what's the big deal? First use, I recreated the jullienned zucchini recipe in a white wine sauce, verdict? To die for, the best part? I had no clue what I was doing and it STILL came out awesome, it allows you to be delicate w/ your vegies, you can do more in my opinion rather than get stuck w/ those clunky oily soggy veggies that ruin the true beauty locked away in the food rather than releasing it. This helps you do that. A little tricky to hand clean with a sponge, so if you plan on cleaning by hand maybe get a scrub brush to give it a good working over.","A game changer.

Salzman recalls his many episodes and adventures there with vignettes in his book Iron and Silk. He reveals much about the contrast of the Chinese culture from western culture.The poverty in this region of China struck me with surprise. Some of the places Saltzman describes as living conditions seem medival for the 1980's. I was also touched by the politeness and respect shown to Salzman, a white man, by the inhabitants of China. Americans could certainly use a few pointers from the Chinese. Overall, the poignant accounts in Iron and Silk will stay with the reader.","Poignant accounts.

1,Good budget mic for vocals or instruments!,"Bought this as a first mic to take some abuse from different vocalists, in my home studio. Thus far, with the exception of a burst shockmount band, it has held up tremendously well, so much so that I automatically reach for it whenever I have to mic a narrator. I have also used it to record percussion and acoustic guitar, which it does really well, without that raspy high end that some condenser mics give.As far as comparison goes, I find it similar to but a bit more sensitive than my Rode NT-1.","Good budget mic for vocals or instruments!.

1,A great film that got me thinking...Can it be that easy to infiltrate the Mafia,"Just kidding, that aside, i watched this simply because of the fact that it is based on a true story. It's not more of 'a' true story but the most infamous story in American history. I noticed that 'true stories' that are diverted into films always become some of the most epic films ever seen, and sometimes it can be embarassing i.e Ed Wood and Pollock. Donnie Brasco, maybe one of the most famed and celebrated films of the late 90s was also the most brilliantly acted from the entire cast. From extras to supporting roles such as the fantastic Michael Madsen and his rendition of Sonny Black.The story is fast paced, often changing the relationship between characters and bringing out the actors out of their shells to purly shine. This is not a big review because there's not much to say but that this is truly fine work and one of the most unforgettable and controversial stories in the United States.","A great film that got me thinking...Can it be that easy to infiltrate the Mafia.

0,Limited efficacy,"I've been bouncing from one alternative deodorant to the next for several months now with mild success. The Anthony Logistics alcohol-free deodorant was attractive for its lack of aluminum as an ingredient. Through the initial use I did find that my underarms could tolerate the formula. Other brands have produced adverse skin reactions. Unfortunately, the lackluster performance of the deodorant to actively control and/or eliminate body odor was not encouraging. I could get through midday without any perceptible smell, but after lunch this product would not continue to work as desired. Sadly, I am trying to use up the stick by only applying it when not in the workplace (i.e. weekends). Your mileage with this product may vary.

This is the first band I've heard since then that has a very fresh sound. The first I heard a song, I downloaded a few more and then bought the CD. Listening to the songs, I truly feel like the band is having fun making good music, not copying other bands and trying to make a million bucks. I listen to this CD over and over again.","One of the best new bands I've heard in a long time. Loopy pop is how I describe their sound.

0,"Practice What You Preach, Mr Schlesinger","This book is well written and underlines the dangers of a society in which the cement of society is so fractured that everyone feels entitled to act without regard to a social norm. However, Mr. Schlesinger is hardly the man to trust on such matters. His standards of proper behavior depend solely on one's political allegiance. He has argued on the one hand that a black man is not entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court because of allegations that the man made a dirty joke (never mind that his accuser had serious credibility problems). Then he turns around and defends Bill Clinton against (much more credible) allegations of rape by arguing that ""gentlemen always lie about sex."" The only problem with multiculturalism is its potential for creating a nation where no one can agree on what is right and what is wrong. Mr. Schlesinger, it seems, cannot even agree on such matters in his own mind.","Practice What You Preach, Mr Schlesinger.

1,Solid!,"The case is substantial but still small enough to fit in any pocket on my camera bag. As a novice with DSLR cameras I don't yet need to store 8 or 10 cards so this is just the right capacity. Truthfully, even if I go beyond the 4 card capacity of this case I will probably order another one just like it. The two cards I have fit tightly in the provided rubber-like depressions and the case shuts tightly. I can't vouch for it's waterproof qualities but I have no intention of immersing it to find out either. Highly recommended for those who don't need to store large numbers of memory cards.","Solid!.

1,"A bit dim, but all right","Not a bad looking little clock radio. I bought it for use on top of the TV, and for that use, the numbers are a little dim, but still readable. It would be nice if Sony had a switch to adjust the brightness. If there's one there, I haven't found it. The clock radio comes in with the time pre-programmed for Eastern Time Zone. The time zone can be changed through the time setup procedure, and fortunately, so can the time. It makes little sense to me for this clock to be programmed at the factory with the incorrect time -- mine was a couple of minutes off, and had to be adjusted. Perhaps for those people who can't figure out how to program the time, that is a nice feature, as long as they live in the Eastern Time Zone. For the rest of us, the pre-programmed time doesn't make a whole lot of sense, although it shaves a minute or so off the setup time if the clock is running behind time.","A bit dim, but all right.

Because it's so hard to peel, the labels end up mangled and look horrible once you stick them.One more thing, even with the power adapter in, after you print a label a warning comes on saying low power. It does this with batteries too, so if you're using batteries (not a good idea) how do you know if it's really low on power?I've had this two days and it's being returned.","Horrible!.

1,Overall great,"I have used this case for over a year and a half to swim laps and I love it. Each time I use it I swim for over a mile freestyle, so yes it works for an active swimmer with their head fully in the water. The headphones are not perfect, you will sometimes get air pockets which makes the sound go in and out a little when you turn your head, but overall they work. I am able to listen to tunes while swimming laps, same as if I was running. The arm sleeve is the only disapointment, it does not adjust small enough for my arm (I'm small but not that small and it would have to adjust 2 inches smaller - only a massive body builder could use the arm sleeve). I just clip the case on the back of my suit and it works, but I would like to have the armband work.","Overall great. I have used this case for over a year and a half to swim laps and I love it.

0,Battery gives out,"Battery gave out fairly quickly before it wouldn't hold a charge for less than five seconds. I had to open it up to fix and decided it wasn't worth spending the money to buy a new battery and solder it back on, instead I by passed the battery and applied 5V directly to the trimmer. Putting it together though was hard as once you open it stuff moves around because as aforementioned it is cheaply made. Would not recommend because it could not tolerate a once a week trim for a more than a few months. Also it cannot be used while charging so once you batteries blow you lose your trimmer essentially.","Battery gives out.

Putting it together though was hard as once you open it stuff moves around because as aforementioned it is cheaply made. Would not recommend because it could not tolerate a once a week trim for a more than a few months. Also it cannot be used while charging so once you batteries blow you lose your trimmer essentially."
0,Falls short of the hype,"Prior to purchasing the Tae-Bo beginners video, I spent a lot of time reading the feedback online. After seeing the mixed reviews that are out there, I decided to try the videos for myself before passing judgement. I cannot believe this workout video has received the national attention that it has! I admire Billy Blanks strong marketing/PR strategy efforts but feel that this video falls very short of the hype. The video production quality itself is very poor- Surprising considering the $35 price tag and the workout itself is anything but the motivating, fun workout it is advertised to be. I am in the process of taking Billy up on his money back guarantee to invest in a better workout video. I would recommend to anyone considering this video to either rent it or borrow it from a friend before making the purchase and having to return it as I do.","Falls short of the hype.

1,"Very good, but editor's judgment biased?","I found this collection to be quite through and wide-ranging, overall very good. The only criticism I have is that the editor and publisher display a Great Britain bias. Numerous speeches by members of Parliamant, etc. are included, despite their seemingly limited subject matter and relative lack of eloquence. I would have preferred that other speakers from around the world have their presence included or increased or, simply, to have had these speeches omitted.That said, however, I reiterate that it is a fine edition, worth the reader's time and money.","Very good, but editor's judgment biased?.

0,This is a waste of 90 dollars,"At first when I received this product for Christmas, I was very excited because I have a lot of digital photos that would be nice to display. However there were a couple major problems with this picture frame:1. The display was quite poor, but I guess that's what you get for $1002. The video and sound was pretty much useless.3. The reliability is very poor. After 3 weeks the frame started making a squeeling noise. We sent it back and then received another one that didn't even turn on. I sent that one back for a refundIt appears that there are better digital picture frames for just a little more money out there so I would pass on this one even though it isn't very expensive.","This is a waste of 90 dollars.

1,Shocking!,"Can you believe that Stalin had a plan to invade Germany before Hitler invaded Soviet Union? Whether you believe it or not, this book deserves your reading.

And he fortunately got previledge to access Soviet Union's secret archives. What he said in this book is quite different from what we learned in high school. And his version of 20th century history is more persuasive, of course.","Shocking!. Can you believe that Stalin had a plan to invade Germany before Hitler invaded Soviet Union?

1,Love it!,"So far I'm really loving this camera. I had an older cannon that took 2AA batteries that were ALWAYS running out and so wanted to upgrade to one that had a rechargeable batter. The camera is easy to use, (I haven't even opened the manual, just played around with the camera itself) and the pictures come out beautifully. I love the large screen. I haven't actually printed any of the pictures yet but I'm sure they will come out well.","Love it!. So far I'm really loving this camera.

1,These books are amazing,"There is a reason that fans of P.C. Hodgell can be seen frantically scanning used bookstore shelves looking for the elusive copies of her books. They're amazing. The stories of Jame, her brother, and the other members of the Kencyr are enthralling and gorgeously written--the world they inhabit is one of the most original and complete in all sf/f and the stories themselves are complicated enough and fascinating enough for any reader. If you want enthralling characters, interesting background myths and some of the most lyrical writing anywhere..these are the books. plus, they DO have a sense of humor! This book, in particular, is wonderful because it brings together the first two in the (currently) trilogy and a few short stories that also take place in the same universe. A must for anyone--pick these books up and you won't regret it! They're wonderful!","These books are amazing. There is a reason that fans of P.C.

0,A boring read,"I found this book to be quite boring. The characters held no charm or interest for me.

Some of the liberator cables also have a second outlet on top giving you even more places to plug in your electronic devices. I would recommend everyone to purchase these cables. They are reliable and way cheaper then having to buy a second power strip so all of your electronic equipment is plugged in.,Great way to utilize entire power strip receptacles.

0,Experiment in Terror by Schifrin is a Bore!,"I keep on saying the best Lalo Schifrin is on his Jazz and soundtrack albums. He is specially a master in scenes of action on which he lays music with fresh movement, full of rhythm and harmonic insight, generally with the best orchestras and musicians in the place. 'Bullitt', 'Mannix', and 'Mission Impossible' are perfect examples of this.Now that Mr. Schifrin created his own label Aleph Records, these important soundtracks have seen the light of day in CD format. Very good!Unfortunately, 'The Amityville Horror' is a Schifrin's experiment in a series of terror ensembles with the same old clichés of this category.

Was Moe ever caught and prosecuted? Did Troy Aames die?But this book was real; it allowed you to experience what happened firsthand; and while it dealt with serious, weighty issues, it was a joy to read. Anyone who hasn't read it has missed something. It is MUST reading!Mildred D. Taylor is a gifted author with few that are her equal. She has the ability to write in such a way that the reader lives the story instead of just reads it. Because that is true, her books do, on some level, change the lives of those who read them.","A gripping book that leaves you longing for more.

1,Works as described !,I bought this Deltran battery tender for my boat batteries. One of my batteries is five years old and was completely dead. The tender brought it back to full power after two days of charging. I now have it hooked up to a new battery on my other boat so that it will be fully charged and ready to go boating in a few months. I like the quick connects and it's a great little slow trickle charger for the money.Highly recommended !!!,Works as described !. I bought this Deltran battery tender for my boat batteries.

1,Good portrait of a dysfunctional family,"Troy Alleyn is commissioned to paint a portrait of the great actor Sir Henry Ancred. Though thanks to journalist/friend Nigel Bathgate she has some idea of what's in store for her, nothing fully prepares her for the amount of in-fighting, jealousy and histrionics the Ancred family can provide. Against this backdrop, Troy is reunited with her husband, Inspector Alleyn, who has been away on CID business for a couple of years. This book is one of the more interesting novels, in that: A) You get to see the beginning of the mystery from Troy's point of view. B)Marsh really knows how to write about awkward reunions and C) You get to see something of the artist's process (not surprising, I suppose, since Marsh herself painted). Another good read by Marsh.","Good portrait of a dysfunctional family. Troy Alleyn is commissioned to paint a portrait of the great actor Sir Henry Ancred.

I took some extra long ribbon and tied it to each side of the remote. If he drops it now, it will just hang there.After each use, you need to open up the battery compartment and let anything wet dry out.

1,A Helpful Memoir for Women,"Liz Perle does a really nice job in ""Money, A Memoir"" of weaving statistics, professional studies, and other people's experiences with her own personal experience and insight. While many parts of her book sound familiar (e.g., women shopping when they're in a slump) it does look below the surface at some of the root causes of our unhealthy relationship with money and why we differ vastly from men in that regard. The other thing I appreciated about the book was that Perle doesn't claim to have all the answers, and explains how she was able to find a happy medium in her relationship with money, which to me sounded like something I could attempt and achieve. Thanks, Liz for a very important memoir that women of all ages should read!","A Helpful Memoir for Women.

1,One Of Anne Rice's excellent work,"I read this book and enjoyed the characters very much. I especially liked the story between Daniel and Armand. Louis, I found very likeable and not depressing a character as in Interview With A Vampire his love for his maker Lestat was genuine.I didnt want the story line to end. I also thought the introduction of Akasha, as the Queen of the dammed interesting, as a Person who is very interested in the ancient Egypt. This was a story line worth reading. Marius was also the as the shoulder everyone cried on, as was Maharet and Mekare. I just hope when they make this into a movie as they are planning to do they dont change the story line. I have heard they they are going to give Lestat a lover named Jesse, who is a minor character in this book. Lestat's real love is Louis. I hope Hollywood does not become too homophobic. If this book is done into a movie it should be done right, and enjoyed by myself such as I enjoyed reading it.","One Of Anne Rice's excellent work.

It still was not at all stable and the entire thing came crashing down on me. I've now taken it apart and put it back into a box. I'm going to contact the company and ask for a refund and will never recommend this product to anyone.","Not happy at all. I first starting putting this rack together the moment I got it.

I can not say how well it would have worked, as I received it with a piece of the tip missing and it seemed to be losing another piece next to the lost piece.

0,A terrible followup to Ender's Game's magnificence,"Ender's Game is one of the best novels written. Not only is it a purely enjoyable read, but it surrounds and is encapsulated by situations and events that will leave you thinking for months and years afterwards.As good as Ender's Game is, Xenocide is unworthy to follow it. It follows a simplistic premise and frustrating story. Even if you ignore the total lack of scientific developments in the hundreds of years passed since Ender's Game, it's still just a boring, unfortunate followup to a sci-fi classic.The only thing worse than Xenocide is Children of the Mind. Skip them both - if you must know what happens, ask a friend who was unlucky enough to read them both.Card is an excellent writer, and Ender's Game is too good to have been followed up with such a poor second.","A terrible followup to Ender's Game's magnificence.

0,Was great until...,"The motor quit working! I purchased this swing in February and it quit working just yesterday. I called Fisher-Price and I guess I am not the only person with this problem. On the highest swing speed, it failed to move my 14 pound baby (the maximum weight limit is 25 pounds!). The motor was progressively getting louder before it quit working. I have since purchased the 'Ocean Wonders' swing. Personally, I feel that the 'Ocean Wonders' swing is a better choice. It gives you more room below for storage. It is also more colorful and provides more to entertain baby. (Not to mention it's nearly $20 cheaper!) Overall, I would not recommend this product, especially if your baby is dependent on a swing.","Was great until.... The motor quit working!

0,nothing good,"We bought this model to replace an older B&D that quit on us. The new model is slow. Over 12 minutes to brew a pot. It steams up the windows in the kitchen. The old one never did that. The pot dribbles when you pour it if you don't open the lid a little, then you get steam directed on your hand. When you set the timer you can barely see the tiny ""timer"" light. I could tell if the timer was on on the old one from across the room. It was very inexpensive and it makes a descent cup if you are willing to put up with all the other issues. Oh yeah, it seems to only come in black.","nothing good.

He just happened to be there when it was filmed at some hall.

1,Simply Beautiful!,"Before I get into it, let me just say I've tried to keep my fandom of the bunnymen on the back-burner while writing this. The fact is that this is an AMAZING RECORD! It picks up from where ""Forgiven"", (the last song on Evergreen) leaves us, and continues it's beautiful melodies, song after song. Fom the opening title track, I felt we were in for a great lesson in well-crafted songs. The record is heavy on strings and melodic arrangement, to it's credit mind you. Ian's voice is as strong as it is equally soothing, and Will adds the right guitar work at all the right moments. This is perhaps quite a distance from something like ""Do It Clean"" or ""The Cutter"". I tend to liken it to a 90's version of ""Killing Moon"", or even 1987's ""All My Life"". In the end, every track makes it a simply beautiful album that flows with more maturity, love, loss, introspection, and hope. Already an album of the year candidate for me!","Simply Beautiful!.

1,A great start to reading Amanda Quick,"This was my very first Amanda Quick novel and came very highly recommended. I really enjoyed the idea behind it. Julian is a dark hearted Earl who's first wife died in mysterious circumstances. Sophy is the country blue-stocking who will become his bride. Sophy isn't just looking for a marriage of convenience, though, she's looking for love. Sophy was a great character. She was funny, light hearted, smart, and spunky. Her interactions with Julian were wonderful and their sparks together were sexy. What I wasn't convinced of was Julian's growth in his love for Sophy. Yes, he declared that he loved her but I didn't believe him. I think his growth in their relationship could have been a little bit stronger. Other than that, I loved the story line, I loved the characters, and I will try and read much, much more Amanda Quick.","A great start to reading Amanda Quick.

1,What is Lightbody?,"I was pleasantly surprised by this thin volume. The first 30 or so pages get bogged down in introductory material, including a dedication, acknowledgments, a forward, an 'onward', a preface, a parable, a 'clarion call', another preface, and an introduction. However, once the book actually starts, things take off. Despite the subject, which is difficult to capture in words, the book actually contains effective and practical tools for attuning to your true core and to the universe itself. Unfortunately, one of the main tools is potions and elixirs available only at a website. However, I found the many 'invocations' to be quite effective as affirmations. This shouldn't be your only or even your main source on your life journey, but I consider this a nice addition to my library.","What is Lightbody?. I was pleasantly surprised by this thin volume.

0,"Okay, but not great","I've had other ergonomic keyboards before from Adesso and really enjoyed them. This keyboard however is flat, which is not at all what I wanted. The function key support is alright, but sometimes malfunctions. As has been noted previously, the 6 key is on the wrong side of the keyboard. The software interface for the keyboard is patchy at best and does not always work well. The USB ports on the keyboard work okay as long as you're not plugging in external storage devices; for some reason, the devices have a nasty habit of disappearing from the desktop.

1,Definitely worth my time,"When I saw MORE ANNOTATED LOVECRAFT in my local chain store, I snapped it up. Loved the photos and the annotations. I hadn't read the weaker stories before, so that was an added pleasure. Actually, I liked those lesser stories more than the editors' introductions would have led me to believe. Although it would have been nice to have seen more of Lovecraft's best stories in this volume, I can understand the mix. If all of his best are annotated first, then readers will have only the lesser stories to look forward to. While I wouldn't wish to rush the editors, I eagerly await another chance to have my Lovecraft experience enhanced.","Definitely worth my time. When I saw MORE ANNOTATED LOVECRAFT in my local chain store, I snapped it up. Loved the photos and the annotations. I hadn't read the weaker stories before, so that was an added pleasure. Actually, I liked those lesser stories more than the editors' introductions would have led me to believe. Although it would have been nice to have seen more of Lovecraft's best stories in this volume, I can understand the mix.

First, to find that by ""reversible"" the manufacturer means only that one can mount it facing either way: second, to find one can NOT mount it either way in a sliding window, since one such direction places the adjustable shutter down, forbidding extending it.","Disappointing.

1,Strangers In Paradise - Strangely Entertaining,"Momma Sisko and the other kids may not like that title, but I do. I've heard a lot of singer/songwriter projects over the years, and this one's a real standout.Good, solid writing, outstanding production and a real sense of heart to Nelda Sisk's music herein contained.Buy a copy, and you'll be transported to a Texas Road House, ala The Devil's Backbone Tavern, one of the last two places Hank William (yeah, I know there's no such thing as ""Sr,"" but he was the first one everybody knew) played a paying gig. You can still see the bullet holes in the walls, and you can almost hear Smokey Dacus warming up for a standup drum solo.She can swing that good.And, that's a good thing.In the event it's gone unnoticed, I like this CD. I own one, and I just might buy another.","Strangers In Paradise - Strangely Entertaining. Momma Sisko and the other kids may not like that title, but I do.

1,Best thing ever!!,"We recently moved into a newly renovated house and wanted to contain our dogs to the family room to avoid scratching of our new wood floors. This product is amazing. After one step, neither dog will go anywhere near it. Finally I can leave things on the kitchen counter without fear of the dogs getting it and I can open the front door without them trying to run out. I have been shocked by it a couple of times and it is not inhumane. It is a tingle at best, and the good news is that both dogs only had to touch it once to get the idea. Well worth the money, even though I paid $119 for it a Petsmart. Wish I would have seen it here first!!","Best thing ever!!.

1,A good BP system with an adequate software link,"Liked the quality of the blood pressure unit and cuff comfort. The system is limited to holding 34 determinations though. You download BP and Pulse information to your computer. It stores the new information. You can then print plots of your BP, pulse over time. The software accumulates BP information so you do not seem to be limited to 34 determinations. Can hold data for two patients and the software plots the data for each user. Good price - adequate software.","A good BP system with an adequate software link. Liked the quality of the blood pressure unit and cuff comfort.

0,Purpose driven life for born agains,The title should properly read 'The Purpose Driven Life for Fundamentalist Christians' because that is who it is written for.

1,surely........one of the best metal album of the year.,"Frankly, i wish megadeth win the grammy. This new album called 'united abomination' is great.The first 5 track are fast, heavy but melodic too. Others track still good but the most interesting is the solo part on the end track called 'burnt ice' .....increase your volume before listen! The japan release come with bonus track 'Out On The Tiles', another great performance from the deth dealing with cover version. Surely...one of the best metal album of the year. If you have more money, get the japan release one. Enjoy the cd.","surely........one of the best metal album of the year.. Frankly, i wish megadeth win the grammy.

0,Terrible sound,The sound on this dvd is just gruesome. Performance is way below expected. This is one in a long line of music dvd's and bd's which has terrible sound. Why bother to release such items? Does not the producer or the performer LISTEN to the sound before release? I think not. What a waste of money. I am sick of beiing robbed with bad releases like this. Also- the other reviewers here- how can they give top ****** for this? Reviews like that are misleading consumers.,Terrible sound.

0,Not exactly what i had expected.,"Chess. Not much to it. However since i was a first time player to the game, i thought due to other reviews of this game that this would be the game i needed to teach myself how to play. How wrong i was. It's not that this is a BAD game, i guess my complaint is more along the lines of the user interface. I'm pretty well rounded with computers and software, and even i was confused as to how to change games, change boards, difficulty, ect ect.I passed the game along to a few other people, and not to my surprise, they returned the game back to me after about a day reporting the same frustrations that i was having.All in all, i learned to play the old fashioned way, on a real board.","Not exactly what i had expected..

1,Introduction To Seth,"This was the first of twenty + Seth books. Intended to offer a taste of future Seth material, this manuscript certainly whet my appetite to know more. While the Seth information was channeled forty years ago, I consider Seth to be the father of the new age and self-help movement. Far from some pat or compassionless oversimplification of how we create reality, Seth leads the reader, with clarity and humor, into the incredibly complex world of the soul. This book demonstrates how we are all ultimately connected with each other, God. The authenticity of the material is indisputable making this (as well as all Seth books) an essential read for any sincere seeker.","Introduction To Seth. This was the first of twenty + Seth books.

1,Emphasis here is on symmetries.,"I was expecting something along the lines of an updated Lanczos (The Variational Principles of Mechanics). But the emphasis here is very much on relativistic symmetries. Actually the book reminds me somewhat of Penrose's _Road to Reality_ and -- perhaps a better comparison -- Longair's _Theoretical Concepts in Physics_, with a mix of popular and semi-popular exposition, historical background, and more detailed mathematical exposition, but with a focus on relativistic symmetry (which still allows for a pretty wide-ranging number of topics in physics).One complaint: the paper, printing and artwork are rather poor for a $45 paperback. Oxford and Cambridge Press, for example, produce much higher quality paperbacks in this price range. I've knocked off a star for that.","Emphasis here is on symmetries..

1,Thorough treatment,"Levy presents a well-articulated, easily read treatment of the Tabernacle of Moses, its furnishings, utensils, services and priestly clothing and functions. A great book to read to see how God was foreshadowing His Son, Jesus, well before His incarnation. Levy clearly ties together Old Testament practices & theology, which we often ignore, and New Testament beliefs. I would recommend this to anyone interested in understanding: (a) more about the Tabernacle itself, (b) a deeper insight into Jewish practices and their foundations, (c) a fuller and richer understanding of God's plan of redemption and atonement, sanctification and regeneration, worship and communication with God.","Thorough treatment.

If you just leave it in the drawer, it drains the batteries so you also have to replace them the next time you want to use it.

0,Cadderly the demigod,"While I enjoyed the premise, improved villians, and character development during the first 3 novels in this series, I found myself unable finish the 4th, as Cadderly has grown from a talented but sorely inexperienced initiate of Deneir to a virtual demigod.The attaction of Cadderly to me was the idea of a heroic character who survived as much on wits, intelligence, and able teamwork as overpowering force. And while this often held true through the initial books in this series, Cadderly is a one man wreaking crew here, his otherwise potent companions often serving as little more than conversation pieces and humour devices. Ancient red dragons, interplanar beings, arch magicians, the outcome of any encounter is never in doubt. Honestly, the only apparent way to defeat Cadderly is to gag him. While others may appreciate a seemingly omnipotent hero, I was gradually left without any feeling of suspense, and ultimately a lack of any interest to continue reading.","Cadderly the demigod.

1,Great Story,"C.M. Whitlock's The Price of Immortality is setting the pace in fantasy! He does what no author has done before. He gives us a world of good evil and the gray in between. None will regret reading it! He weaves a web of intrigue and suspense in this world of magic and mayhem. The characters of this story have been magnificently conceived, growing into real people as you read, people who you will both love and love to hate. I've read many fantasy books but this one has held my interest the most. The plot is so intellectually intricate it keeps you reading until the final chapter. The characters are also very developed which makes reading about their hardships and triumphs even more exhilarating! If I had to compare him to anyone I would say that he is a cross between Robert Jordan and Ann Rice with a little Steve King thrown in. Definitely my favorite of all time, and it will make your best seller list too! Five stars all the way.","Great Story. C.M. Whitlock's The Price of Immortality is setting the pace in fantasy!

Amazon made it very easy to return, but I decided to buy a machine locally instead of ordering online again. I bought the Cuisinart CBK-200 2-Pound Convection Automatic Bread Maker. My first one burned the loaves, so it went back to the store. My second one has been working well for a couple of months now. I wish quality control was better for appliances like these.","Heating defective. Add me to the list that received a defective machine. I really like the style and the features of this machine.

1,Good historical account,"Good book, very fact filled and well researched. The author was very knowledgeable about the subject, however it was a little more detailed than I wanted. It was written at a higher level than I would have liked. I believe the author was aiming for a more academic crowed, and I'm just a dabbler in this subject. I knew nothing about the subject and now I know a whole lot more.However, since I knew nothing to start with, I was very fascinated by the whole idea of the spirit of democracy of the time being manifest in the church of the time. Whether it was good or bad I will not give an opinion and the author did a good job of sticking to the facts and leaving his opinion out of the copy as much as possible.If this area of study interests you, I would recommend the book. If it's only a passing fancy of a possible interesting read, you might want to think twice.","Good historical account. Good book, very fact filled and well researched.

1,"Fun, fast read",I read this book over the holidays for some light reading and found it very enjoyable. For chick-lit it had some great twists and turns which left me guessing to the end. Each time I thought I figured out which Mike she had picked there was another twist and it left me guessing to the end.I would recommend this book if you want a light read and something to make you think about your own past relationships.,"Fun, fast read.

0,Great concept but unreliable,"My first unit was also DOA, second worked fine for 11 months and then failed. It registered ok with the T6c watch but erratic / intermittent speed recording.The grooves for the battery cover are also a little flimsy - easy to strip off if you don't get it aligned just right.that said, the Suunto gear is great at recording data and providing feedback, just not so good at interval trainingCheers","Great concept but unreliable.

1,AWESOME...TOTALLY!!!,"My hubby got this set a while back. Loving it!!! Having gone to high school & college in the 80's, these songs bring back great memories. It's funny that kids in high school are now having ""80's parties"" and that these hits are now becoming ""oldies"". Our eleven year old has put some of these on his ipod!

0,Doesn't stay put,"The concept is great but needs to be improved upon. The part that you lay on constantly wrinkles, bunches up, and shifts around b/c there's nothing keeping it laying flat while your bodies are naturally moving on top of it. It gets realy uncomfortable having the material bunch up under you and you need to keep fixing and adjusting it. I'm disappointed since there are very few of these types of items available for bedsharing with our infant. I wish the sheet part was longer so that it could be tucked under the other side of the mattress or something - that way, maybe it would stay put.","Doesn't stay put.

1,Good Breakthrough Effort,"If you like contemporary Dancehall music you won't regret picking up this album. Its fun to listen to, with the megahit ""Gimme The Light"" as the centerpiece. But I wouldn't buy an album unless it has at least four wicked tracks. ""Like Glue"", ""Concrete"", ""Can You Do The Work"", ""My Name"" and ""Punkie"" more than qualifies it. ""Street Respect"", ""Esa Loca"" with Tony Touch and his Spanish remix of ""Punkie"" are good too. The surprising disappointment was the Neptunes-produced track.I still think his first album Stage One was slightly better but this one is defintitely worth getting.

1,N or M review,"This book, in the Kindle format, is one of the later books in the Tommy and Tuppence series. Agatha Christie does not break up the original grouping of characters, so even Arthur is brought back to play a pivotal role for all that it was not the highlight of the book. Her presentation of the characters at the boarding house where the book takes place does keep you guessing as to who the N or M characters are, in addition to the wandering female and the subset of other male characters that add to the plot. It was a good basic mystery that didn't take too much time to read and ended well, as they always do.","N or M review.

1,Great product,"To answer a few questions...It's a 6"" utility knife, a 3 qt. pot, and the book is called ""The Cooking Club Cookbook."" I think these products are great, this set sells for [$$$] at other stores and would be worth every penny. I've owned it for a month now and it is the best pot and knife I've ever owned.

Unfortunately, the exchange copy discs presented the same problems. Amazon could not help me, though they gave it it a good try; we agreed that exchanging my copy for a new one again would likely lead to the same problem again and that the defects in the discs were out of their control. I called the publishing company and did not find them to be helpful. I found this frustrating and disappointing, as I am left with a defective product with no recourse. I had been looking forward to getting the book/DVD/CD for months, fully expecting my previous experiences with McKenna's products to be repeated.

0,inferior to the first volume,"Don't buy this one until you find somewhere that you can sample the tracks, such as perfectbeat.

Having it in your jeans pockets or even in your chest pocket is a big no-no: You either hold it in your hand or you put it on your upper arm: obviously this does not deliver the benefits of going cordless..."
1,The Reef Set,"We have used the Reef Identification series for years and this new update is a great addition -- many more fish are identified. The writeups about each fish are very detailed and explain behaviours and various color shadings well. The photos are excellent, and we have always been impressed by the amount of work and care that have gone into the series. This is the first time we have had the Reef Coral book and are as pleased with it as with the quality of the other two books.","The Reef Set.

1,No kids-but nieces,"My husband and I have no children, but have two nieces (9 and 5) and a third ""niece"" (3). There is nothing sweeter than a 3 year old singing ""Cheeseburger In Paradise."" It is fun to hear the kid-friendly songs and the sweet mumblings about a big kosher pickle, even though the recordings can get annoying (it's so worth it). Now that they know the lyrics, maybe they can go with us to the concert next year! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! :-)","No kids-but nieces.

1,Fear No love is a Sick and Wonderful Album,"Bob Ostertag Assembles a great cast for his advant release ""Fear No Love.""With Mike Patton, Trevor Dunn, William Winant, Fred Frith, Justin Bond, and many more great Guests. Its a little twisted, a little techno, and a little Gay. Its dark pop Dance music with great beats, smooth guitar, sharp electronics and a little bit of Everything. Ostertag recorded all tracks in his home and then assembled them afterwards. Recording each performer seperately. If you can get your hands on it still, Do it. Its a rare little gem of an album and it is quickly dissapearing. Dont delay.","Fear No love is a Sick and Wonderful Album.

The Donizetti music alone is such fun all by itself, but adding the opera itself makes it magical. I can't imagine anyone who enjoys light opera not loving this.","L'Elisir d'Amore.

0,It's gonna get better - how could it get worse?,"Well, it did get worse - Invisible Touch and Calling All Stations were conceived and released.

Then the ideas dry up, and the band has even said as much when discussing the ""rest"" of this album. Illegal Alien is an embarrassment. The remaining songs are filler at best. Silver Rainbow has an enjoyable driving riff, but those lyrics -ouch!

1,Creates a lot of questions about Thorne,"I enjoyed this breezy and interesting book. It is not heavy on forensics (that is a good thing, in my opinion) but it is based on characters and feelings. Billingham writes about female characters particularly well and every so often will write a paragraph or page that is so striking and thought-provoking that it makes the price of the book.The part of the book that I am so-so about is the actions of the lead character Tom Thorne. Without giving any spoilers, he makes a couple of decisions in the book that are questionable morally and professionally, I am not sure if the author needed to go down this path.As with all of Mark Billingham's books, very readable.","Creates a lot of questions about Thorne.

0,"Oh, come on. Who cares?","I finished the Club Dumas and I'm wondering why anyone cares. The plot is ridiculous. Some greedy and somewhat sleazy book merchant chases all over the Iberian peninsula and France for two books that will supposedly summon the Devil while a bunch of Eurosnobs plot to keep a handwritten chapter of a Dumas book from public scrutiny - all the while belonging to a club that reprints ancient dime novels? Minute details about book collecting overwhelmed me with tears of boredom. There's the stereotypical fetching young woman who all we know about is that she uses a name from a Sherlock Holmes story and is a kick boxer of some talent because she can beat up an actor? Meanwhile, the evil ""pay no attention to the man behind the curtains"" guy surfaces only briefly at beginning an end. And if I read the word ""apocryphal"" one more time I would have puked. The ending, especially the last page, is so trite I would have expected it to come from a John Grisham novel. And I LIKE John Grisham.","Oh, come on. Who cares?.

0,Acceptable at best.,"If you're not picky about your images and just want a light-weight, stylish camera, the DSC-T100 is fine. I just upgraded to it from a DSC-W1, which I'd had for years. I was really happy with my old one and thought the update sounded wonderful, but I think my old camera took better shots. With the DSC-T100, I get a lot of noise in every picture, I get chromatic aberrations around even mild highlights and the pictures also have a lot of ""lens bend"" to them. In a word, my pictures look cheap. When I looked at people using the same camera on flickr, I saw a lot of the same issues in their shots. If everything I just wrote sounds like gibberish, you'll probably do fine with this camera, but I'm disappointed that Sony put out such a bad camera.","Acceptable at best..

0,SAY WHAT?????,"If you are looking for a book that really teaches how to minister to or instruct the heart of a child, as a parent, or teacher or guardian.... the book I would strongly recommend in place of this one is ""Connection Parenting: Parenting Through Connection Instead of Coercion. Through Love Instead of Fear."" The book is absolutely phenomenal!! And unlike this book it not only leaves the child with his/her dignity in tact, by treating them with the same respect that God treats us with, but teaches the parent exactly how to form a very healthy intimate and mutually respectful bond (which yields to obedience by the way) that will last a lifetime between parent and child. Invaluable tools! Don't waste your money on Ms. Plowmans book. Children are too precious to hurt. There is a much better way, and your child will become a stronger, more self confident, happier individual...FOR LIFE !!","SAY WHAT?????.

1,Very underrated talent...,"This is Moore's 2nd release from 1995. With any airplay, this guy would be a big favorite with fans of hard blues or southern rock. Much better than average vocals nicely complement his expressive guitar techniques, elevating Moore above your basic blues/rock guy. There is also a nice mix of acoustic, R&B and Gospel. Many of his riffs are very familiar with various classic songs for playing ""name that riff"". ""Stain"" sounds like another man from Austin named Edgar Winter, especially with the horn section and wah-wah sounding guitar.

The story of predjudice towards different classes of people is changed when to people fall in love with each other, but it takes awhile for the two main actors to find each other.

1,Best movie of the year!,"Troy is probably the best movie of 2004, which is saying a lot, considering 2004 was a superb year for movies making such soon-to-be classics like Sky Captain, National Treasure, Van Helsing, and Phantom Of The Opera. Troy is a thundering action epic, perhaps even better than Return Of The King. Brad Pitt stars as the hulking action star Achilles, while Eric Bana plays the Trojan prince Hector. Orlando Bloom also has a supporting role as Paris, Hector's younger brother who starts the legendary war in the first place. The swordfight betwixt Achilles and Hecotr is perhaps the best in any movie, and is definitely worth checking out.

You want to like it, you really do, but the discrepancies in the sound and structure of the songs when compared to what made you like the previous albums so much, is too much to overcome.

I honestly dont do this every time, and it's still been fine.Great teaching tool. Used them to teach about what each animal is called, what it says. Jokingly ask 'do we eat this animal' to teach about foods. Can be quite educational. Not to mention teaching about water displacement (air replaced with water for squirting).Durable, fun, inexpensive - can't go wrong with these.","Great Bath Toy!.

Some are both.Were I an instructor of poetry, for any age level but especially high school or college, I would assign Liz Waldner as a poet to explore when YOU want to explore. I think her true ability lies in leaving the confines of simple narrative and moving into the way our minds actually work and process information and feelings. And unlike e.e. cummings, to whom you might compare this poet, Waldner embraces science, refreshingly not only for its conclusions but as a source of raw inspiration.

1,The fun continues in Coolboarders 4,"I owned Coolboarders 3, so when I heard about 4, I ran out and bought it right away. I was not dissappointed! The tricks and boards are rad and I liked the addition of the real boarders. The coolest thing about this game is racing the avalanche. I have had this game for about three months and still have not beat it. It drives me crazy, but I keep trying!","The fun continues in Coolboarders 4.

1,Wonderful book for babies and small children,"I bought this book for my son when he was three months old. He was mesmerized by it the first time he saw it. The illustrations are simple and colorful. This is the only book that he will look at over and over without throwing it aside. The rhymes are catchy, too! I've read it to him SO many times, all I have to do now is recite a few poems and he flashes a smile immediately! Buy this book! You won't regret it!","Wonderful book for babies and small children.

0,Not worth it,"You do get what you pay for, I guess. I purchased this speaker when Amazon offered it at the $19.99 Gold box price. I'm very glad I didn't pay more for it. The sound is quite muffled despite repeated adjustments to the treble and bass. It's fine for a travel stereo but the quality is sadly lacking. It is not worth more than what I paid for it certainly. If you're looking for a better quality, light weight speaker system for iPod, I would recommend theJBL On Tour Portable Speaker System ( Black )","Not worth it. You do get what you pay for, I guess.

1,All time best werewolf movie,"***Very slight spoiler***Okay, I admit, I haven't seen every werewolf movie ever made. But the best of what I've seen doesn't rise above B-grade, and usually not that high.This film, on the other hand, is amazing. Outstanding acting and directing, one of the best scores I've heard in a long time, great story and terrific script. The only weakness was in the area of special effects, but this is so much more drama than horror that to me, that hardly mattered. If you don't like horror, watch it as a drama. If you don't like drama, watch it as horror. And if you don't like either, you might enjoy it as a comedy--watching Mimi Rogers as the sisters' uber-suburban, perky (step?)mother, carrying a tupperware container with two human fingers inside through a sort of goth-rave is only one of the funniest moments.","All time best werewolf movie. ***Very slight spoiler***Okay, I admit, I haven't seen every werewolf movie ever made.

1,Still relevant and compelling,"I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the convergence of the real world and dream world, traditional and modern, young and old.... This film represents the hands that my own great-grandfather used to plow the fields of elite plantation owners.

1,Good tape for the exerciser non-enthusiast,"I've had this tape a few weeks and really enjoy it. I am not co-ordinated, so for me, this tape can get a little confusing when Denise starts combining moves. Like many people have mentioned in reviews of some of her other tapes, some of the counting seems to be off---but it's not that big a deal to me. I like that it's divided into two 20 minute segments. I have three kids, ages 4 years and under, so a 20 minute segment is all I can fit in at night. The second segment that involves the weights is the most enjoyable to me. This tape has motivated me to use other Denise Austin tapes as well. It's a good tape for beginning and intermediate exercisers.","Good tape for the exerciser non-enthusiast.

1,Very Thought-Provoking,"This book is laid-out very well and quickly draws you in. You must be patient when reading the book. Many points that are made throughout come together later. Evidence (some perhaps coincidental) mounts as you are taken from continent-to- continent, and you are also versed in map-making and astronomy. You can't help but to take notice. I almost gave this book a 4 (instead of a 5) due to its shear size, but you just have to stay with it. Have fun!","Very Thought-Provoking. This book is laid-out very well and quickly draws you in.

1,Great Crate,"We purchased one of these and when it came in the mail, we were very impressed with the features of this crate compared with our other crates that we presently own. We just love the feature where you can attach it to the seat belt. We also love the space to store a leash or treats on top. We would always misplace our leashes before, but not now. The door is easy to open and close. The colors are attractive. The little trench in the bottom edges is nice in case your pet has an accident so that they are not totally sitting in it. My old crates were totally flat on the bottom and if they had an accident it got all over them, not fun when you are getting ready to arrive at the vet. We are planning on replacing all of our crates with one of these. Made in the U.S.A. another great plus.Plus's: Trench in bottomPlace to attach seat beltLeash and/or treat compartmentAttractive colorsEasy to open and closeMade in the U.S.A.","Great Crate.

0,Skip this early work of today well published author (also known as Amanda Quick),"Looks like I'm the only one here who found the book less then average. As in nothing remarkable, nothing memorable, nothing interesting. Heroine was over enthusiastic, hero over sarcastic. She was too innocent (to a point one can call her stupid) and he had super ego (not in a positive way). The story had interesting premise, but it has been done a thousand and one times, and this version of it was not well executed. I found my self bored and skipped whole sections. As it turns out I didn't miss anything. I read books by Amanda Quick (also known as Jayne Ann Krentz) that I enjoyed, but this was a waste of my time. Skip this early work (1989), of today well known author, because it is that EARLY WORK and definitely NOT her best.","Skip this early work of today well published author (also known as Amanda Quick).

1,Great Fun for 7 and 4 year old,"Yes, the price is a bit much considering what comes in the box - that's why 4 rather than 5 stars. However, I don't know that I've ever come across guar gum or valerian root powder in my routine shopping or otherwise. So you pay a few extra bucks for convenience - big deal. The kids have an absolute blast and they are loving learning about science with hands on experiments. Bacteria, molds, snot, gag, digestion, blood - what's not to love? We've completed all but two of the experiments and they've all been easy with results as described. We're waiting for our cultures (snot, dog slobber, toilet rim stuff, and a little girl mouth swap) to grow out so we'll have to wait and see on that one. Unlike one of the other reviewers, our prep of the gelatin for the petri dishes went beautifully. Plus, there are enough supplies to do all of the experiments more than once if you are willing to rinse out the balloon and a few other easy things. We all highly recommend.","Great Fun for 7 and 4 year old. Yes, the price is a bit much considering what comes in the box - that's why 4 rather than 5 stars.

1,I'm Hooked,"This book was well done! I found myself dwelling on the characters and caring about their well being between times when I could read it. The Christian theme is not preachy and overdone. It also gives a real picture of issues women had to deal with during that period of history. We take for granted some of the freedoms and choices we have today so this book caused me to be more grateful for the time I live in. Overall, a heart lifting story that will make you feel good inside.","I'm Hooked. This book was well done!

We don't mind hearing this over and over again in the background as our 26 month old daughter watches (she's been hooked on the LP shows since she was 6 months old!). It has a pleasant sound and clean-cut teachings. Not grating to the nerves like Dora the Explorer and Blues Clues. The only thing I would like to change is the DVD Menu. Right now, the episodes play 5 at a time - I wish it gave the option of playing all 10 back-to-back. Otherwise, fantastic DVD with 10 great LP episodes! Another good one is the Creativity Collection! Just avoid the Storytime Collection as it is half repeats and almost nothing new.","Very wonderful!. We love this Little People DVD, it is cute and refreshing. Very adorable!

As for me, this $70 is the last that Disney will ever recieve from me and my family. With as many bad reviews as this toy has (I should have checked out the reviews before hand.) They know there is a problem with this, yet they allowed it out of the store anyway. TOYSRUS are contempable in my eyes from this point further. Merry Christmas, yeah right...

0,Cheap and tacky - won't protect your screen.,"Shame on me for thinking I had gotten a great deal when I ordered this case. Nowhere on the product description does it state that there is no plastic protection for the video screen - it's just a square hole in the metal case. Having always used a leather case, I just assumed ALL cases would have this added protection. While I know I could purchase separate plastic pieces to serve the purpose.........why should I have to? Don't waste your money. This is cheap, tacky, and a rip-off......even at less than $5.00.","Cheap and tacky - won't protect your screen..

1,This is the one to buy.,"Our family has been using this electric kettle on average 2-3 times a day over the last 12 months and couldn't be happier. It consistently boils a full tank of water (about 1.5-1.7 Liters) in 5 minutes time versus around 19-20 minutes for a typical water kettle over a gas range. Surprisingly, we have noticed no decrease in the amount of time that it takes to boil a tank of water over that time period (even after upwards of 800 heating cycles). The brushed aluminum finish looks good on the counter and it is easy to clean (mouth is large enough to fit your hand in it). The auto off feature is a nice touch as is the little 'ding' that indicates that the kettle has finished its heating cycle. Overall we are very happy with this purchase and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.","This is the one to buy..

1,"Black Hawk Down, the best movie of all time!","As said, this movie definitely is my favorite of all time! The true story of the botched 1993 U.S. raid in Somalia that turned from a military mission to a hasty rescue operation was a very inspirational film as the pointless objective of those soldiers immediately turned into an incentive to get their brethren out of the clutches of the troubled city of Mogadishu. Ridley Scott's amazing visual attention and Jerry Bruckheimer's unstoppable action filmmaking truly account this classic as not only the best war movie ever made, but the best movie in general.","Black Hawk Down, the best movie of all time!.

1,A little disappointed,"First I want to say that I LOVE the fact that this set comes with two adapters to connect the old blue TOMY track to the brown Trackmaster track. Kudos to whoever came up with that idea. The set itself has two problems. One, it only comes with one stack of 'wood' and the logs from other sets are too long to be used with the lumber yard. The second issue is that the sliding pieces on the lumber yard are difficult for small children (my son is 3) to use and they fall off easily.All in all, it's a fun set and the adaptors and bridge pieces that come with it make it a worthwhile purchase for any Thomas fanatic.","A little disappointed.

1,Suggestions for K-A,"I've used the juicer attachment for years and love it except for the comments about the strainer being too small. A strainer with an extended pulp reservoir out the front would help, if it didn't get in the way. The extension would have a solid bottom and be ribbed so that the pulp could be pushed forward with a teaspoon to drain, thus extending the time between pulp dumps. Also, the comment about shaft wear/squeaking are valid. I have a small tube of food-service-grade grease I use on the shaft: never even thought about shortening. Very clever! Also, different-size reams for limes to grapefruit would be a nice way to sell more stuff! One more thing, K-A: how about a nice low-speed coffee grinder attachment? Mine would live attached to the mixer, as I use my Krups grinder every day, and could use the counter space. Maybe an ice crusher/shaver, too!","Suggestions for K-A.

0,Bill Cooper Was Clinically Insane.,"He should have been institutionalized for his own safety and the safety of others. He made numerous threats against respected academic researchers and heavily exagerated claims of his own first hand knowledge on these matters, especially regarding Majestic 12. He was also connected to the extreme right-wing, anti-tax movement, though he was not an official member of any militia. Not only did most abduction researchers shun anything he said, but even former associate Bob Lazar (the discredited Area 51/S-4 guy) distanced himself from Cooper. The man became increasingly unstable and by the end was wanted by the U.S. Marshalls on felony charges. On 11/5/2001, police attempted to serve an unrelated warrant against him for assault and endangerment. He opened fire and shot one of them in the head. The remaining deputies returned fire and killed Cooper.","Bill Cooper Was Clinically Insane.. He should have been institutionalized for his own safety and the safety of others.

It spattered the broth of my roast all over the counter and I had to fill it up with water twice to keep it from burning. The lid was horrible because it rattled from the broth boiling. It is very dangerous when chilren are around. It is too easy to get burnt from the splattering liquid.

0,stay away!!!,"I bought one from a local Walgreens; it will not even turn on. The only way I could get it on was to take the battery cover off and adjust the battery, only having success when it is barley connected; and then it shuts itself off after 5 seconds or the battery pops out.Definatley a great way to give your self a headache and wast $10.Not even worth the packaging it comes in!","stay away!!!.

1,fascinating social treatise,"First of all, let me just say that I read this book several years ago, so it's not fresh in my memory, but when looking at some of the one star reviews here, I couldn't help but laugh at how some people can be so biased against a book that seemed to have offended them. I'll put it this way: if you need binoculars to see halfway to sociopolitical middle, you will be offended. This is absolutely NOT a one star book. It's well-written, insightful, and poinient--and I'm saying that as someone who considers himself left of center. I never at any time felt like I was being condescended to, as some of the reviews suggest. This is a good book, and you will look at our culture a little differently after having read it. I should also point at that a similar title on the growing trend of narcissism was written by a psychologist by the name of Jeanne Tweng, which came out at the same time this book did. Her book is a little more sour grapes, but it's a very good read as well.","fascinating social treatise.

0,Very weak science,"I agree completely with M J Edelman's review. He gave it 3 stars; but, despite skillful writing, I can't give it more than 2. I'm a mathematician with a strong background in physics, and very much agree with Edelman that Ferris is simply repeating a lot of what he has absorbed, much without understanding it well. I was led to believe from the Amazon profile of Ferris that he was a scientist -- that's a natural conclusion when he is credentialed as an emeritus professor from U of C Berkeley, who has taught astronomy at 4 universities. But he isn't a scientist at all; he has only a bachelor's degree in journalism.","Very weak science. I agree completely with M J Edelman's review.

1,The Veranda Brand is a hit,"This cover is great.Fits right and looks great. I expect the best from this cover and would recommend it to a friend.Tucson, Az.Adding to this, the time is now 2 years later. June 2012. The cover is on my bbq in the direct Az sun. No problems, no weakness, still goes on and off easy. It does have a zip pocket which i don't use. And it has two handles that make alignment easy when you put it back on. No complaints. At this rate, I expect at least two more years.","The Veranda Brand is a hit. This cover is great.Fits right and looks great.

1,"Are you fascinated by history, but tend to struggle when reading ""historical books?""","Books written by Michael and Jeff Shaara just might offer the best chance to bring history alive for you!It must be noted (as the authors do) that these books are in fact novels. This distinguishes them from pure history books in that the authors have taken some literary license in an attempt to get inside the thoughts and minds of the historic characters that are portrayed in their books. Although the plot is based on historical fact, both Michael and Jeff Shaara attempt to enter the consciences of the Great Founders of our Country to bring them alive in the minds of their readers. And, much to my enjoyment, I found myself flying through these books about history the way I would a Nelson DeMille or Robert Ludlum novel!","Are you fascinated by history, but tend to struggle when reading ""historical books?"".

So I call Optima and tell them I cannot return it to AMAZON due to federal regulations, so can I take it to any auto parts store that sells Optima's?..... NO.... has to be taken to a Interstate Distributor and has to be tested over night... hmm... closest Distributor is 100 miles away... so basically they are telling me I would have to drive a total of 400 miles to get this POS replaced... This is the second Optima I've had that died long before the advertised longivity... but it will be the lst one I buy.","Another Dead Optima. My red top died after 14 months.

0,I couldn't finish,"As a Spike fan, I should have listened to the warnings. But I figured if Spike is in it, I want to read it.I couldn't finish it. It was just too frustrating and angering.Spike is seriously injured saving Angel's life, still lying in bed unrecovered but instead of thanking him Angel is hatefully insulting and threatening him. Not only is this insulting to Spike's character but Angel's as well.The same goes for Buffy's treatment of Spike. It makes her seem like a horrible person.I can't tell you whether it ends well because I only got halfway through. I am an extremely fast reader so normally I would just bite the bullet and finish quickly but in this case it was just raising my blood pressure too much.If you hate Spike you'll probably cheer but other than that skip this book.","I couldn't finish.

My GOD!No, the album is NOT perfect. What is? It may have been overproduced. Give the BSB and Krystal a break. This is her first time recording an album with a label, and this the first time BSB has OWNED a label. This was a test drive for all of them. It was a good first album.

0,Don't expect a quality product,"I had previously purchase a minnesota fats corner cue rack from K-Mart. It was solid wood and very good quality but was flawed. The felt area for the cue balls was too close together and at the most you could only fit 14 or 15 balls on it. Since, the only reason I purchased the product was for storage of the balls and cue sticks this was unacceptable. I returned it and searched amazon where I found the mike massey rack.The Mike Massey rack is made of pressed board and is painted. I put my rack together on a soft surface and the paint chipped off the front edges exposing the black pressed board underneath. This product is flawed in that the paint does not adhere to it. This product is very poor quality. Only buy if you don't mind a little wear leaving it looking like it came from a thrift store or a garage sale.","Don't expect a quality product.

1,I CANT QUIT !,"Let's face it, not all electronica/soul cd's are worth your buy. Many times I'll try one out and toss it a month later due to unoriginality and boring melodies; but when a friend of mine handed me the dubut album by this woman, I was hooked solid. It's hard to sum this sound up into words, all I can say is that it's a rhythmic journey through soul and fire which takes the listener into various emotional terrains and leaves us looking to buy property there by the end of the album. This album is suggested to you with my highest reccomendation, and I am a musical SNOB so these reccomendations do not come easy!. Check her out, buy the album or find a way to become introduced to this fine quality of music.","I CANT QUIT !. Let's face it, not all electronica/soul cd's are worth your buy.

1,Great electronic file system,"Although I can't give this product a perfect five-star rating, it still is worth the investment. I am impressed with the overall accuracy of the OCR capibility and the flexibility of the filing system. The major drawback for me is the lack of full integration with the newer versions of Quicken, which is my main financial management software. It requires several extra steps to transfer all the scanned info and not all the fields that I need in Quicken are available in the scan batch. However the ease of use and the fact that receipt, bsn card and other documents can be stored with a compact device 'on-the-run' compensate for most of the awkwardness.","Great electronic file system.

In a carefful, thoughtful and compelling way, Greenwood invites the reader to consider a new paradigm of Christian ministry within the Anglican expression of Christianity.This book is essential reading for clergy and people who have run into the hard wall of congregation economic viability, reached frustration about mission and evangelism, or who simply believe their congregation could be better. It is important reading for Bishops, clergy and laity particularly those exploring total, mutual, collaborative ministry.I would encourage you to read his other books as well, not currently listed with Amazon","Excellent resource for exploring renewed Anglican ministry.

1,Very good ergo mouse,"I purchased this ergo mouse because of my painful right index finger due to mouse clicking (trigger finger). Now the clicking is done with my right thumb. Press thumb down for left click, and press thumb up on button for right click. Very simple. When I use it I have no pain in my finger and can tell my finger is slowly getting better.The only complaint I have is that the scroll button is sensitive so I find myself either scrolling too fast or putting too much effort into trying to scroll ""just right."" But I think the scroll mechanism can be adjusted so it's probably just me.It comes in 2 sizes. For most people, the regular size is fine. If you have really big hands you'll want the large size. It also comes in a higher priced model sans the wire.All in all I recommend this product as a viable alternative to the regular mouse.","Very good ergo mouse.

1,Bought as a gift for my nephew,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew and he absolutely loves it. It is fun and educational which I love, as does his mother!! i can not yet comment on its durability as he has only had it for a few days but it looks like it will last.The only slight problem is that he has a hard time opening the container and if left to play with it by himself he may over do it on the sparkles. I would suggest that this toy is definatley used with adult supervision for any child under the age of 12.","Bought as a gift for my nephew.

Reads like a novel.I wouldn't worry about suspected minor innaccuracies. Maybe most people can't rent a car in Bermuda, but if you have $50 million I'll bet there is a way around it. As far as Ivy league schools not giving athletic scholarships that is not exactly true. It is a matter of semantics. Most people familiar with education in the Northeast understand that prep schools and Ivy league universities don't give ""athletic"" scholarships, but they do give ""financial aid"" that just happens to fall substantially upon good athletes even if their families are well off.","A Great Read.

0,Soemewhat disappointed,Looks are great. Item dents very easily - do not remember dropping it and there are new dents. Does not keep water cold. Top must be on tight to keep water from leaking. Top inconvenient to open and close (many turns). Difficult to clean - requires brushing. Very overpriced for thin aluminum cylinder. Either price comes down to $5 or this is a quick fad.,Soemewhat disappointed. Looks are great. Item dents very easily - do not remember dropping it and there are new dents. Does not keep water cold.

1,Big surprize!,"I read the book before I bought the video, and as is usually the case, the movie did not quite reach the level of enjoyment as the book, but it was darn close. The cast was well picked, and did a great job. I thought there might have been a little too much preaching than was needed, but it was, after all, meant to be delivering a strong message. Good family video if you, the parent, have the time to explain what is going on to the younger viewers. Buy this video, and watch it often.","Big surprize!.

The concept sounded good so I decided to try it out and see if it really worked. Well, after following the instructions to the letter, I was quite disappointed. The printer would not print anything except for the diagnostic test message from the bi-admin software provided by Linksys. It's been a week with fiddling with the software, uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, updating firmware, etc. but the thing still doesn't work. The Linksys website has sparse information on troubleshooting too. Didn't bother with Linksys tech support since their reputation is pretty bad here. I am returning this product.","Piece of Junk.

0,This razor,"This razor does look nice but I feel as if that is all it does. When it came to me in the mail, I had to sharpen the edge and hone it because it was not sharpened. When I did get a nice edge, and finally used it it would not hold the edge worth anything. In my opinion you are better off using this money on a better made blade with a harder steel. Also I would not recommend a new user on getting this one because they will have a miserable experience.","This razor. This razor does look nice but I feel as if that is all it does.

0,Must have a defective unit.,"I bought this radio because of the good reviews. I liked the digital tuning. It was very easy to lock on stations and the presets are also a nice feature. The sound quality was another story. Many of the other reviewers had commented on the very good sound quality, but the unit I bought sounded so bad that neither my wife, nor I could listen to it for more than a few minutes. Actually it sounded like what you would expect from such a small radio. I might have just purchased a defective unit. I just can't imagine how anyone could say my radio sounds very good or even ok. If you are thinking about buying one, check out the return policy. I sent mine back and I think I'm going to get hit with postage both ways plus a restocking fee. Ouch!","Must have a defective unit..

1,One of the best books i've ever read!!!,These books (especially number 3) are absolutly brilliant. The plot is consistantly action packed and emotional. Most of the characters develop really well throughout the books and there is an obvious change in their attitudes at the end. The stories are a cross between horror and romance and some parts are so moving and of course there was Julian! I think me and the rest of the female population really want a Julian in our lifes after those books.I always cry at films but this was the first book i've ever cried at before. I sat in my bed at midnight sobbing my heart out but although it was sad it couldn't really have ended any other way and there is a small amount of hope at the end.If you haven't read this trilogy what are you doing!?! I read these in five days when i should have been doing revision but i was just so hooked. They are a must for everyone even if you don't like reading i promise that you will enjoy these books.,One of the best books i've ever read!!!.

1,Back to Basics,"Pete Seeger's Storytelling Book by Pete Seeger and Paul DuBois Jacobs reminds us of the importance in telling stories to our children. With all the different parenting books around, this book is a wonderful reminder that what really matters in a child's life is time spent with an adult and connecting to them through words, ideas and history. The stories are warm, clever, funny and easily retold with our own words. I was inspired to start telling original and some not so orginal stories to my children. Hands down, they want ""mommy stories"" everynight instead of ""book stories"". Pete Seeger's Storytelling Book will be given at all my family and friend's holiday celebrations this year. What a great way to celebrate the real millenium; with a tribute to the past. This book is a must buy for parents, grandparents, anyone who loves and spends time with children.","Back to Basics.

1,Digital Audio Optical 3 link,"The Toslink digital Optical 3 link was recieved via regualr mail, in a yellow medium .99 mailer. The only protection was that of the small bubble wrap in the orginial box. Looked new, I was worried that it might have been handled roughly,during shipping as it was not packed as should have been for the way it was built. For the cost of the shipping it should have been better. Item does work, but time will tell. I have it conencted to my Direct Tv, Toshiba HD DvD, Playstaion 3 and my Toshiba reciever to the DvD Optical side. No instructions, you have to snap each cable into the switchbox until you here a small click. Be careful, as the optical cables have to go in a certain way. The switchbox is not heavy, in order to switch you have to hold the device and turn the knob. For the price, not a big deal, 101 percent cheaper than buying a new reciver with three optical inputs. I have ony two on mine.Again item is great, shipping/packaging can be improved...","Digital Audio Optical 3 link.

They ruin the whole album. ""Who's Got My Back"" despite its awful title and overly-drawn-out intro is the standout track. The album cover is laughable, not that that matters.

0,fascinating retro-driven pop,"on this record the verve sound an awful lot like a looser, funkier version of barret-era pink floyd. each of the songs is a little gem save for 'endless life' goes precisely nowhere. the shorter version of the title track on the group's eponymous EP is probably more satisfying, but the other numbers are exciting ('man called sun' is a vast improvement over the studio version).","fascinating retro-driven pop. on this record the verve sound an awful lot like a looser, funkier version of barret-era pink floyd. each of the songs is a little gem save for 'endless life' goes precisely nowhere. the shorter version of the title track on the group's eponymous EP is probably more satisfying, but the other numbers are exciting ('man called sun' is a vast improvement over the studio version)."

1,The Complexity of long term policy planning strategies,"The visionary ideas put forward by Lempert, Popper and Bankes work not only for business analysis but provide thought -provoking models for many different types of long term planning. Of particular interest to the general reader are the discussion of conditions of deep uncertainty and the necessity of seeking robust strategies.","The Complexity of long term policy planning strategies.

0,very scary,It is almost midnight on a school night and my daughter is camping out on the floor of our bedroom... still not asleep. After complaining about a scary book her first grade teacher read to her today I checked it out online and found this haunting cover looking back at me. I know you should not judge a book by its cover but i think an exception must be made for this book. And apparently i am not alone in this thought. It may be OK for some kids but i think this book and the whole concept of someone's skin turning into stripes is just too much. Especially for little 6 year old girls who have school the next day!,very scary.

0,Disappointing Christmas Present,I received the Revereware seven piece set for Christmas. I've used the frying pan maybe four times. It warped. The current pans are not the same quality they were 15 years ago. The stainless steel is not as thick and the copper bottoms look painted on. I'm afraid to give them a good scrubbing for fear of scrubbing the copper right off. The pans are also not made in America any more and the poor quality of the pan reflects that.

1,Light and humorous,"MJD's novels are always a delight. Even her acknowledgements are funny as she points out in this novel that the book would not have been possible without the author (and of course Godiva chocolates)! The Undead series centers around Betsy, the unwitting Queen of the Vampires, and her adventures with her consort, Sinclair. In this book, Betsy discovers she has a half-sister, Laura. Of course, Laura is the daughter of the devil (and is anyone surprised that Betsy's stepmother was possessed by the devil?) and bad things happen when Laura loses her temper. Meanwhile, Betsy manages to temporarily alienate her friends when she reads the Book of the Dead. This is a light and humorous novel that made me laugh out loud.","Light and humorous.

1,Best kept secret and most useful recovery book on the market,"After many years of study on conflict and peace-making , I was amazed by the usefulness and wonderful information packed into this small book in a readable, easy-to-understand style.

Both my husband and I read it in one afternoon and have used what we learned everyday since and have shared it with many others.

1,So addicting...,"This is quite posssibly my favorite 360 game yet. I haven't been able to put it down, it is simply too addicting. Like others have mentioned, the voice-over work is phenomenal. Getting Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall in the game is unreal. It really makes you feel like you're there. That said, this game doesn't even need the Godfather universe to be great. It's just icing on the cake. The game itself is so engrossing. The missions are fun and challenging, the open-ended gameplay of doing whatever you want is great, and the fun never seems to end. Just make sure you have plenty of time to play this. Once you start, you may not be able to finish.","So addicting.... This is quite posssibly my favorite 360 game yet.

1,The best book on the Gospel of Christ I've ever read.,"This book shows a true concern for accuracy of doctrine and a desire that as many people as possible share in the glorious good news of the grace of God which is found only in Christ Jesus. The author writes as a man who has struggled with the issues personally and resolved them in a reverent, accurate, a understandable way. Mr. Wilson is a man with both a first rate education and real-life experience in dealing with the issue of personal salvation. The book is not wordy or inaccessible. It it lucid and organized and betrays a great amount of thought, inquiry, and scholarship. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone. The work is equally suitable for the inquiring unbeliever, the confused or hungry believer, and interested scholars of all persuasions.","The best book on the Gospel of Christ I've ever read..

1,Best Book Light I Ever Owned,"This is the best book light I've ever owned, and has made reading in bed next to my husband a real possibility for the first time in our marriage. It's plenty bright, very convenient, and the batteries last a long time. It's also handy as a nightlight in a pinch.I'm only giving it four stars though, because they need to make a few improvements. First, it's a bit heavy. When you're trying to balance a book, and this nightlight, it can occasionally feel like a juggle. Second, it scratches and smudges like crazy. I personally don't mind it--I can read through the scratches and smudges without issue, but eventually, I'll buy another one, or a cover for it.","Best Book Light I Ever Owned.

0,"Average shave, high consumables cost","I've had the 7526 for almost two years now. The shave is average, but the cost of consumables has been what I feel is high.

If you expect a winning combination in THUNDERBOLT FROM NAVARONE, though, you will be sorely disappointed. The story was not captivating, the characters were not interesting. The cliff-hangers were paraded past like a sad Indiana Jones wanna-be. This is no successor for Alistair MacLean. Again, Sam Llewellyn's yacht racing mysteries are very enjoyable, especially if you're a Dick Francis fan, and I am looking forward to the next one of those.","Not a winning combination.

She is doused with alcohol so that the police will think her a drunkard, and her story of her child's abduction to be merely the ranting of a street person.Though a book source I found said the book was for readers 9-12, I would not give this novel to anyone under the age of fourteen or fifteen.

0,My least favorite Swedish Beauty lotion,"I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about 10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand. I've tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite. It's thicker than most and the smell is terrible! You definitely don't want to use this unless you can shower right away - in addition to smelling bad, the smell seems to get worse after tanning. I go to an awesome salon and with their beds normally see a difference in my tan the day of my tanning session - not with this lotion. The only use I can see for this product is maybe as a pre-tan moisturizer if your skin is very dry. I have had much better results tanning using lotions without bronzers from SB. My current favorites from SB are Priceless and Bronze Beauty - pretty much the same lotion but Priceless is from their blush line.

1,Informative synopsis of brain function and sexuality.,"The book offers some generally well applied research to show that all of our anatomy is affected by the hormones that determine our sex. It isn't at all offensive to me. I believe that we were created male and female--and for a good purpose. There is something to be said for being a ""sexist"" (if I may use the term), since humans are either one or the other. Of course, there are many variations in personality. But any reader who denies that differences do exist between the male and female brain which translate into male and female behavior is being intellectually dishonest. The authors are just stating the obvious, but in a more detailed, scientific way. We would do well to heed its conclusions--one physician's review.","Informative synopsis of brain function and sexuality..

It is thin light and comfortable to wear all day long without any discomfort, even when typing on a computer. The display is crystal clear providing you with the day of the week, time, and date. It has a very wide viewing angle compared to other more expensive Casio G-shock watches. The light does its job. There is an alarm clock and hourly beep. This watch provides everything you would want and nothing more. It is affordable and lasts forever. You can't go wrong with this watch.","Perfection.

It is better then the movie because you get to make up your own idea of what Terabithia looks like.

1,Simply beautiful,"A friend living in another country mailed this album to me as a birthday present 6 years ago. I have been astounded by the beauty of it ever since. ""Nella Fantasia"" takes me on a wondrous journey through dreamland, and I cannot listen to ""Love of My Life"" without tears welling up in my eyes. ""Green Fields of France"" will surely leave the listener with a stark sense of how terrible war is, regardless of political views or national/cultural backgrounds. I gladly recommend this album to anyone who simply wants to listen to beautiful music.","Simply beautiful.

1,I Know What You Did Last Summer,"I think that this book is a really good book to read. This story makes you feel like you're actually there witnessing it all happen. This is about four drunk teenagers that hit a kid, riding on a bicycle on a dark road. Now someone is after the four teens that hit the kid. This book takes you on a big adventure you'll never forget. I think the only thing that should have been changed was the book should have been related to the movie. I really liked how the killer discuised himself as a nice outgoing guy. I was suprised that no one got killed in this book. This book was supposed to have taken place in 2000. If you like suspense books I would really reccomend this book.","I Know What You Did Last Summer. I think that this book is a really good book to read.

1,Recorded straight from the console game,"Streets of Rage 2 had one of the best video game soundtracks on the Sega Genesis, which is why it was the first or second game soundtrack I actually recorded from the game itself and burned onto a CD, way back in the mid-late '90s. (I'm so glad I got the Genesis with a headphone jack for Christmas and not the compact model which was already on the market!) The music was so awesome that I still listen to that CD often while working on the computer.What surprises me about the official soundtrack here is that, according to Amazon's samples, it's a straight recording from the original game's music renderer, whereas most game soundtracks released in the 21st Century (regardless of how old the original game is) are remixes either performed live or rendered with modern music synthesis software. But that's okay, because it's so good it's still worth listening to! It looks like the only thing missing from this soundtrack is the short ""Stage Clear"" tune.","Recorded straight from the console game.

1,Big Fat Surprise,"Frank Miller is at it again. The man who made the public take comics seriously with ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is now at work with the Sin City series, making his name as the Quentin Tarantino of the comic book. His work sizzles like a hot California night and there are times when you can smell the gunpowder on his pages. For this particular entry, a nasty customer winds up starting more trouble in Sin City then he's prepared to handle. It's only after the poor lug gets what he has coming to him that the clean up begins, and Miller's protagonist, tough guy Dwight, has to help the girls protect the City they call their own.While not quite as stirring as the Batman or Daredevil works, this Sin City series is Miller to the max, and that makes it worth the read.","Big Fat Surprise.

But to lie and say that you spent three months in jail after getting out and driving straight to your girlfriend's house to find she'd committed suicide is a complete joke.

1,Transform Your Life,"There is nothing better than a woman who undertakes a journey, then shares her experience with others. No matter how knowledgeable and/or articulate your doctor is regarding the need for-and affects of-hormone therapy, the trials and triumphs of Suzanne Somers encourages the reader to believe that, she too, can navigate this passage successfully. Whether you are a Suzanne Somers fan or not, her book is aimed at the enormous population of female baby boomers walking into an often misunderstood and misrepresented time of life. Suzanne's passion for living, intelligent writing style, and easy to follow instructions makes this book a 'must have' for any woman interested in maintaining her physical, sexual and emotional health. I continue to give this book to friends, and enjoy knowing that I'm giving a gift that can, literally, transform their lives.","Transform Your Life.

0,Terrible setup and dodgy performance,"This was tricky to set up, in part because the documentation is horrible.Some of the 'boosters' posting reviews here gloss over the fact that the WMB must be connected to the PC via ethernet for the initial setup wizard (which disconnects that PC from access to the router, which makes getting the router info a little tricky). It's only after that setup that you move it to your living room / entertainment center and connect it to speakers.My biggest complaint is with the performance. I'm getting audio dropouts (one-second gaps in playback) at the rate of about 1 per minute. The audio quality is not very good (there's no documentation about whether the audio is being re-encoded before the wireless transmission, but I'm almost certain it is - and not with very high quality). And the integration with different media players is spotty.","Terrible setup and dodgy performance.

0,Pretty Pathethic Zombie Movie,The best part about this DVD is the cover art. After reading some reviews where people talked the movie up it's B grade at its best. Looks like it was shot using a handy cam and very B grade acting. No new takes on anything.Basically involves a few interwoven stories of groups of people hiding and trying to survive with a zombie epidemic.A couple of scenes worth watching for the slice and dice but a big let down story wise.

0,Ouch,"So I decided since eveything was in such a hype of dreamgirls I would watch it.Bad idea. Has anyone ever seen movies like Cabaret or hell even Sound of Music?That is how you do a musical, not some horrible cheesefest of actors. I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of Jamie Foxx and his horrible attitude towards almost anything. By the time this movie started to get an interesting plot it was almost over, and the music wasn't even that catchy at all.It was annoying after awhile, actually. I enjoyed this movie when they weren't singing, but it was just painful when they were.Also it was extremely perdictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did, which makes it boring to watch.The only reason it is getting any stars at all is because of Eddie Murphy and when they weren't singing.","Ouch.

I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of Jamie Foxx and his horrible attitude towards almost anything. By the time this movie started to get an interesting plot it was almost over, and the music wasn't even that catchy at all.It was annoying after awhile, actually. I enjoyed this movie when they weren't singing, but it was just painful when they were.Also it was extremely perdictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did, which makes it boring to watch.The only reason it is getting any stars at all is because of Eddie Murphy and when they weren't singing."

1,Perfect for Holiday quiet times.,"This is a compilation of gorgeous holiday arrangements. All instrumental, the sounds are lush, warm, and definitely peaceful. Track #8, Lo, How A Rose, is hauntingly beautiful. Myself a Christmas historian, I have hundreds of Christmas CDs. This is the first album I play each year in order to ease myself into the season. If I am looking for something to put me in the ""Christmas mood"" i.e. something jovial, this wouldn't be the album. No tinny-sounding keyboards or electric guitars. This collection is soothing and calm, one to be savored by the lights of the tree. It would also be a lovely backdrop for a time of Christmas devotion or meditation. These arrangements, though familiar carols, are fresh and unique sounding. Peaceful, but definitely not elevator music. Treat yourself to a rare moment of tranquility this Christmas. Buy this album.","Perfect for Holiday quiet times.. This is a compilation of gorgeous holiday arrangements. All instrumental, the sounds are lush, warm, and definitely peaceful.

1,Thule works,"Just got back from a 1600 mile road trip with 5 bikes in the rack hanging out the hitch of my wife's XC90. My bike is the only one of the five that fit perfect, two of the bikes were my wife's and my daughter's and two were my sons' all of which did not have a cross bar to sit over the rack's two bars in a ""pretty"" manner. With some patience and wiggling all five bikes fit and were strapped snug over the rack. It held really well even through the hills and mountains of northern Georgia. The bikes come off easily and we were able to unload. The only problem is that if the rack is fully loaded with five bikes you better have a good reason to get into the back of your SUV because it takes three people to gently let the rack down and to put it back up.","Thule works.

After I canceled the order I received an email from the seller telling me that I should have known it was too good to be true and that I would be hard pressed to find a watch under $2000. I just hope that the seller is not allowed to deceive other potential Amazon customers from what is normally a pretty reliable process. For someone that is serving their country in Afghanistan I do rely on the goodness of truth in advertising on Amazon. My money is earned at risk to my life.","WHAT A DEAL! ITS A FRAUD!.

0,Cute Initially but Not Challenging,"I got this game so that my toddler would have something to play on my Playstation. When he first received the game, he loved it (about a week); however, when he learned there were only 7 screens for play, he got bored (3 worlds with 2 adventures plus one that you go in each time you complete a journey). And, changing the levels (easy - hard) only changes the amount of numbers you must find but not the adventures. The only time he pulls it out (once a month, if that) is when I am not available to help him with another game. I feel I wasted my money. And, as another reviewer mentioned, it seems to use the same numbers over and over.","Cute Initially but Not Challenging.

Eastwood is great, as always, although his cop character in this one displays a little more vulnerability than most of his tough guy roles. Locke's acting is over-the-top and annoying, as always. This is a pretty good action movie, but the ending is ridiculous. After blasting the hell out of this bus, the cops are just going to let Eastwood walk up the steps of city hall with a gun tucked into his waistband? I mean, no one says a word to him. And on top of that, he takes the assistant d.a. hostage and Locke's character shoots the police commissioner dead in front of the entire Phoenix police department, and nobody does a damn thing? Are you kidding? I'm all for suspending a sense of reality when watching action movies, but give me a break. This ain't no academy-award winner.

0,Buyer Beware,"Sony has a great reputation, so I thought that when I shelled out tons of money for an MD player it would be worth it. And for a while, it was. It's a great looking model with excellent sound quality. It tends to eat batteries relatively quickly, but since it's rechargeable that's not too much of a problem. What *is* a problem is the quality. After owning mine just over a year, it began skipping frequently and often wouldn't eject first try. The remote also became quirky and would turn on for no reason and drain my batteries. Conveniently, all of these problems started happening soon after my warranty ran out. After about 18 months of use, it died. With no warranty, it was going to cost more to repair than to replace. This is my third experience with Sony CD/MD products, and my last. Each product broke conveniently after the warrantly expired.","Buyer Beware. Sony has a great reputation, so I thought that when I shelled out tons of money for an MD player it would be worth it.

1,best wedding I've been to in years,"A wedding is the perfect setting for A. Manette Ansay to bring a bevy of characters to life and show off her skills as a multitasking/plot developing writer. The characters, from the regretful and disbelieving ex-boyfriend to the all-too-familiar unruly child at every wedding, carry all the faults, self-doubt, and the traits of friends and family members that we all love, despite our own good sense. Ansay does a wonderful job of providing just enough description to bring you to the tragically unstylish scene of the nuptials but leaves enough blanks for each of us to fill in the images with memories of weddings from our past -- from a bowl of chalky mints at the front desk to the well-picked over buffet.

0,I do not recommend this vacuum,"We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use.

Rather, the book presents a much welcomed world view of the cultural development of violence, from pre-history to our contemporary period, broad enough for any reader to connect to it personally. All of Ragan's works that I have read are universal in their dimensions. I strongly recommend that this reviewer let go of what sounds like a personal grudge toward quality literature. I give Lusions my highest recommendation."
1,"Finally, a dream book that gets real","Often when I have picked up a book about dream interpretation, I become quickly disappointed. Not with this one! The author effectively describes how to analyze dreams - by explaining complicated Jungian theory in everyday words. The book contains actual dream examples - that the author breaks down herself; I found this to be a fantastic way to follow her teachings. The dictionary is suberb, finally one that is of real practical use. If you are fascinated by your dreams, get this book! It will help you to truly understand dream interpretation.","Finally, a dream book that gets real. Often when I have picked up a book about dream interpretation, I become quickly disappointed.

1,Excellent quality image.,"We purchased this my wife's grandmother who loves Sound of Music. She only recently got blu-ray and a large flat-screen, so I was dying to see how things looked all together (and force her to use it at least once while we were there). ;) We put it in, and I was floored. The image quality is fantastic. In fact, it's almost too good at times- almost looks fake. But- I think this was ultimately due to the settings she had on her flat-screen. [Someone pumped it up to vivid settings with extra sharpness I believe.] However, even with the settings not optimal (or rather as I'd prefer them), it was obvious that this release was the best in video quality out there. Colors and textures were clean and clear- not muddy. I remember watching it late-night on the old TV and it was horrible quality compared to this. Almost like you're in the movie-theater watching it's release. Fantastic!","Excellent quality image.. We purchased this my wife's grandmother who loves Sound of Music.

1,You CAN QUIT Using the EASYWAY System,"I found Mr. Carr's book to be a very easy read that stated in very clear terms the ""WHY, HOW, WHEN"" of quitting. Mr. Carr gets straight to the heart of the matter - no gimmicks here, no psychological b.s., just a no b.s. approach to why you should quit, how you will be able to quit, and how you can manage not to start again. This book is a must read for all smokers who want to quit, for non-smokers who want to help smokers who are trying to quit, for the smoker who has quit and started again, for the smoker who can't stick with the quit. I would also recommend it for teenagers who have just started to smoke and who don't know what they are in for - they will know after reading this. Most of what's written here you know - however the way that it's written and the manner in which Mr. Carr delivers the message is what makes all the difference. Read it, live it, and finally be able to say....""I'm free at last"". Good luck!","You CAN QUIT Using the EASYWAY System.

1,Great book on 4th generation warfare,"Colonel Hammes does an excellent job in describing 4th generation warfare. His explanation was clear and concise. This book is extremely readable. My one problem with the Colonel's book, however, is his description on how to defeat an enemy using 4th gen warfare. While a 360 performance appraisal, reform of an old supervisory system and a reduction in the officer ranks may help reform the military, it is not the direct actions needed to counter an active enemy. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars out of 5.","Great book on 4th generation warfare. Colonel Hammes does an excellent job in describing 4th generation warfare. His explanation was clear and concise.

1,so?,"I found these stories formulaic but quite good. There were touching scenes with the young couple talking about their lost son, and the Third and Final Continent was exceptional, in its sympathy. Much of the rest of the book I found a bit repulsing because it seemed like she was pulling things out, describing Boston in a way I found misinformed and dishonest, knowing she could get away with things. She can put together a story, incorporate elements into it that are common in NewYorker type stuff, nothing too difficult, nothing nearly honest enough. Not to say that it isn't good reading and that the stories are fluffy, they are not. They are well written, they just leave something to be desired, and I feel a bit like something false is thrown at me.","so?. I found these stories formulaic but quite good.

1,Great book for advanced students in probability,"As many reviewers have pointed out, this book may be too advanced for a beginner student, but it is truly the best for a graduate student or anyone else with solid background in Mathematics and some knowledge of Probability.

Ten years later I still use it; just a few weeks ago I needed to familiarize myself with Brownian bridges and it took me only 10 minutes with the book to get all I need to know - the concepts, the formulas, the applications - to the extent I could explain it to my teammates.I wouldn't recommend this book as the introduction to probability, but for a serious student of mathematics this is a great book to further the understanding of probability and prepare for advanced studies in Stochastic Calculus.","Great book for advanced students in probability.

It is so unlike any other Deveraux I have read that I cannot believe she wrote it -- and the copyright of ""Deveraux, Inc."" only helps confirm those fears.","Awful!.

1,Exactly what I needed,"This is a shorter/wider tote that I can put my tupperware in without having to cram it in sideways and disrupt my leftover casserole or salad or whatever (the biggest container I have that can fit is about 6x9 square on bottom - a tight squeeze but it fits and zippers up). I can't believe how inexpensive it is for the quality! The lining is slightly thinner than what I've seen in more expensive totes, but I use a freezer pack and haven't noticed a problem with my lunch getting too warm. There was an product id tag sewn into the liner that I ripped out by hand, causing the seam to rip a little (totally my fault, I should have used scissors - just passing on a lesson learned) Love the little pocket on the front, too.","Exactly what I needed.

0,A Very Historical Overview of Interiors,"I found this book to be loaded with information. The author did an especially good job of incorporating the political, economic, and social context into the discussion of period styles. My main complaint about this book, however, was the complex writing style. It seemed to jump around a lot in attempt to include a basic overview of everything. This became VERY confusing at times. I feel it would be most helpful to someone who already has a solid background in the history of interior/furniture design periods. There was a lot of information about specific arts and crafts of each period (ie. metalwork, ceramics, woodwork).","A Very Historical Overview of Interiors.

I feel it would be most helpful to someone who already has a solid background in the history of interior/furniture design periods. There was a lot of information about specific arts and crafts of each period (ie. metalwork, ceramics, woodwork)."

0,Don't be fooled into this one,"Got my new saw out of the box, fueled and oiled it up. Followed the directions on starting... so far so good. Engine started right up. I let the engine warm up for a few minutes... went to make my first cut, pull the trigger and the engine died. Ok, no problem, start it back up again, which it did. Pulled the trigger and it dies again. This was my whole day with it. The saw runs great at idle, but the moment I try to make a cut, the engine dies. I eventually get it to cut with some work and pumping the trigger, but as soon as the cut is finished and I release the trigger it dies. I get very tired after an hour of repeatedly having to restart the thing.... so by the end of my first day with it and less than 2 hours of use, the engine still runs, but the chain won't move. It's as if the chain brake is stuck. Anyway, it's going back in the box and back to the store. I should have listened to my dad and bought a Stihl.","Don't be fooled into this one.

0,Not good enough,"The table and chair set is no different than any other plastic chair set sold by Little Tikes, the only difference is the stickers you stick on the back of the chairs and Thomas design on the table top. The chairs are too light and I would need to find a way to weigh it down so my 2 1/2 year old won't topple over. The Thomas table top is not attached firmly and as the other reviewer mentioned, small food particles and such easily get trapped under making it difficult to clean. I basically paid for the Thomas table top and the 4 stickers on the chairs. Nothing extraordinary about this set at all.","Not good enough.

1,Victoriana coming of age,"Admittedly, I do prefer 1987`s 'Helleborine' - as the last reviewer quite rightly said, it`s over-the-top and the classical composition displays so much attention to detail it borders on obsession - but for beauty and sheer escapism hardly anything else comes close. Having said that, 'Century Flower' is a delight to listen to. The sweeping Victorian musical vistas of 'Helleborine' get a kick - there`s a psychedelic Floyd/Strawberry Alarm Clock edge to tracks like 'Timeblind' and 'Self', although the overall effect is entirely their own creation. Highlights are the pastoral country-house loveliness of the title track, the explosive, breathy 'Shatter', the gloriously twisted prettiness of 'Timeblind' and the pounding 'The Silent Day'. A band unlike any other.","Victoriana coming of age.

1,a fantastic hidden rt gem,"Sunnyvista is probably RT's least known album yet it is one of his best. What I love about this album is that it sounds absolutely unlike any of his other albums up to that point or even after. Most of these songs have just great rhythms that at first seem like upbeat songs. Heck, Civilzation is a reggae song! Hoewever, as with any RT song, the lyrics can be just devastating and cutting.The overriding theme of this album is how so many people have just given in to society and its demands of conformity to ideals that really are of little importance. This is well worth getting (much easier to get and cheaper on cassette (ebay) since it's out of print) and is essential for any rt fan.Their are so many great songs but Living on Borrowed Time and Lonely Hearts are just wonderful songs that have such great melodies.","a fantastic hidden rt gem.

0,Might as well use a Ziploc bag!,"These bags are just like Ziploc bags. In fact, I see no difference.

1,I do like this book but....,"Yes, I really do like her writting style, especially the prologue. I was captivated throughout the book only because of her writting style and not because of the plot like I normally would with other romance books. I also like the attitude of the heroine. She is so confident (in her own term), down to earth, realistic and lovely.The only irritation I got from the book is the sound ""Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh"" and ""Ahhhhhhhhhhhh"" when Benedict and Sophie made love. It wasn't supposed to be there, right?? It seems to be the sound people often make when they have their first sexual encounter or when they were in high school. It sounds ridiculous to me, just the soft moan or whispers of each other's names would do. It just doesn't get along very well with the hero and the heroine and the mood of their love-making.","I do like this book but..... Yes, I really do like her writting style, especially the prologue.

1,Percy's most commercial and still brilliant . . .,"The Second Coming sold surprisingly well, probably because it features a quirky love story and has one of the most original openings I've ever encountered. The young heroine has just completed a course of electroshock therapy. Although the procedure leaves her amnesic, she is able to learn what she needs to know by consulting a letter she wrote to herself prior to the last session.Based on that tantalizing start, you might expect a quick moving plot and a tale of conspiracy. No dice. This is Walker Percy. What you're going to get is an exploration of the human psyche and how we manage to get lost from ourselves. It's not a roller coaster ride, but that's not why we read Walker Percy. His readers sail into uncharted oceans.","Percy's most commercial and still brilliant . . ..

I recommend it to anyone that wants a heavy duty workworking vice. My first complaint is the shipping. When it arrived the box had a large hole in it(from being dropped I suppose). The handle is a solid steel bar but yet it was bent when it arrived. So either Record doesn't make their handles straight (doubtful) or somebody dropped it very hard. Anyway it still works fine but when you purchase a new tool it would be nice if it got to you with out being damaged. Also a template for installing it would have saved a lot of time.,Love the vice.

I mainly watched it because of Bas Rutten(UFC Champion,BlackBelt Magazine ranks him as the world's greatest martial artist) He didn't show up until the last showdown match of the movie and didn't say a word,but he did fight well. This is a movie you just fast forward a lot until you get to a fight scene, which was okay if you like wire work (I don't really look for an oscar type of performance in an action movie but the acting in this movie was Terrible!) Do yourself a favour rent ""Belly of the Beast"" by Steven Seagal I'm sure you won't be pushing that forward!"

0,Feel cheated again,"I have been reading Nora Roberts for several years; loved most every word. But I am so disappointed when I find myself paying top price for a book which was written years ago. In most cases, the author has vastly improved her writing and this is true of many of my favorites who are also choosing to pull some oldies out of the closet and sell them again. I dislike having to look for published date in a book when I buy one. Oldies belong in a discount shelf where you can choose to read them again for half price. Even so, I read every single word and it finished up beautifully.signed....Ms. Cheapie","Feel cheated again. I have been reading Nora Roberts for several years; loved most every word.

1,"fun, sweet and optimistic","In these times of war and uncertainty, it is so reassuring to find a pop band that is so focused on the good things in life and so obviously having fun making music.I bought this CD after hearing 'Cary's Here' on the radio. The bouncey little number instantly won me over, as the singer shares the simple joy on his baby sons face when their eyes first meet in the morning. I'm not ashamed to say that it was really nice to find out that I'm not so cynical after all.The rest of the album mixes sweet emotional moments with good time/ big chord rockers that make me wish I were back in high-school, borrowing dads car to drive around with my friends. If I were able to return to those innocent days, I know what CD I'd have on the car stereo.Hop on Pop will make you smile. The songs are well crafted and performed with gusto. The music of Hop on Pop is a party and everyone is having fun. The best part of their party is that we're all invited.","fun, sweet and optimistic.

0,Imports are silly/don't buy it.,"Sorry, but one of only two good songs on the 'Eat Me, Drink Me' album are found right here. Yes, ""Heart Shape Glasses"" is a cool tune...but the other sing isn't worth spit..anyway it's presented. Actually, despite the fact that Marilyn manson has established himself as one of the most meaningful songwriters in Rock History, there is no evidence of that on this horribly rediculous album (Eat me Drink Me). All I can say, is that if your looking for a rip off of My Chemichal Romance, HIM, Modest Mouse...you found it. Manson is still a legend...but this whole concept is his least interesting album to date.","Imports are silly/don't buy it..

0,Why did they cast Bill Murray?,"While this movie may be more ""believeable"" than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it was a poorly directed film with awful choices for casting the characters.

And I don't think I have to say anything about to choice of the casting of the attorney. If you've seen the movie, then enough said about it. While this movie will probably be viewed more in 98-99 due to Fear and Loathing's success, don't expect it to impress you much, and if you thought Fear and Loathing had no plot [which it did], then don't look for one in this movie.","Why did they cast Bill Murray?.

0,I Don't Want You Back by Eamon,"Never did the phrase 'one hit wonder' apply more than it does here. ""F**k It (I Don't Want You Back)"", is this album's only shining star. The rest of the tracks are just copy cats, with painfully poor lyrics & absolutely no fluent melodies or rhythms at all. The truly sad part is, Eamon shouldn't have to end his career after just one song. He actually has a nice singing voice, but the problem is he has way to much artistic freedom, which unfortunatley has been the downfall of many talented new artists. Had Jive only taken more interest & hired gifted producers & song writers, things might have been different. Say hello to 2004's Lumidee, but also remember to say a quick goodbye very shortly thereafter.","I Don't Want You Back by Eamon. Never did the phrase 'one hit wonder' apply more than it does here.

1,Great film!!,"This version took a big risk and, eventhough its tough to see, it was a woderful film.

Having great B'dway stars like Bernadette Peters, Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, Victor Garber, Paolo Montalban and the two step sister brought life, woderful acting, and wonderful singing to the film. Even though Whitney Houston wasn't the best choice for the Fairy Godmother she produced the movie and you have to admit she can sing. The sets, costumes, and special effects were amazing and brought out the story book mood, something the other versions never did and R&H's score was beautifully brought back to its full glory that just wasn't in the 1965 production.

0,A Wrong Choice,"I'm inclined to say it's the worst VSI I've read. I had to make an earnest effort in the second half of the book to keep from skimming-browsing-leaping pages. And it wasn't worth the effort. The author presents a construct (rational choice), and then props it on a score of rules and conditions that must be met in order for choice to be rational. When reality diverges from the model, it's reality's fault, not the model's. This ultra-theoretical giddiness is applied to gambling, ordering food, and other examples that are not as interesting as the subject would've allowed. A comparison with truly interesting books on related subjects, such as Gladwell's Blink or Bennett's Randomness, leaves this VSI in a bad place.The illustrations are chosen haphazardly, often with nothing but a tangential connection to the text. This all adds up to something more along the lines of the author's extremely personal and debatable take on choice theory, rather than a very short introduction.","A Wrong Choice.

1,The start of a great series!,"I am writing this review after reading Tribulation Force and while I am reading Nicolae. If you found Left Behind an okay book don't stop reading the series. I found Left Behind to be okay, but not really captivating. It reminded me of Jack Van Imp's movie Apocalypse. It had a great message, but not really something to convince non-believers. Then I read Tribulation Force. It too like Jack Van Imp's second movie - Apocalypse - ""REvelation"" with Jeff Fahey was EXCELLENT!!So, read the series. The story, the writing, the suspense gets much better as you go, and believe it or not. It is going to happen!You might want to consider watching those movies. The 3rd is coming out in October. At least until Left Behind the movie comes out.","The start of a great series!. I am writing this review after reading Tribulation Force and while I am reading Nicolae.

1,Love it!,"After downloading this cd on a music site i wont mention a few months ago which didnt have all the bonus track on it like this one does. I broke down and bought this one. There is many good songs on here including some of the bonus tracks. There is only a couple weak songs but overall a very good cd to have. When i bought the cd a week and half ago it was 12.99. Now i see Amazon is raising price again. I dont understand why all these old cds arent cheaper, remastered or not i usually dont like to spend more then 10 bucks on a cd. I would like to get maybe her first cd to, but now i see Amazon has raised the price to over 14 bucks! CRAZY!!","Love it!.

1,Such A Rich History Behind This Release -- A MUST HAVE,"As a huge Marvin Gaye fan, I have virtually everything he released. And although I have the original versions of ""I Want You"" and ""What's Going On"", I didn't have the deluxe editions.

After learning the history behind the releases of these editions, I am awestruck. Both are truly timeless classics, works of art that cannot be dismissed. Now that these have been published, I hope that a whole new generation of folks are enlightened to Mr. Gaye's genius.","Such A Rich History Behind This Release -- A MUST HAVE.

0,major design flaw,"I bought this vacuum b/c of the size and weight. We have hardwood floors and a BIG dog, so the need to vacuum is a daily occurance. Initially I liked this vac, because it was light and fairly easy to use.A few minor details-the cord is too short, and the filter gets full quickly, requiring you to remove it and bang it against the side of the trashcan to get the gunk out of the folds. This usually causes a pretty big dust cloud.These things are a little annoying, but not ""deal busters"". The MAJOR design flaw is that the exhaust comes out the front of the vacuum, right above the head. This results in any dust bunnies, dog hair or other lightweight stuff becoming airborn in a cloud ahead of you, and the larger stuff, acting like tumbleweed and rolling ahead of you.You can really tell on a sunny day with the sun coming through the window. Basically you end up stirring up and breathing all that stuff in. Yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bottom line-great idea, poor execution!","major design flaw.

We get destruction of Hoover Dam; Las Vegas sinks into the sand; Mount Rushmore crumbles, and Houston is dessimated.While probably not geologically accurate, I found the movie pretty much enjoyable except for the too lengthy rescue sequence in Las Vegas, but the first half and the final third are pretty involving. There are no super star performances, but you get adequate ones from Kim Delaney, Frank Langella, Dean Cain, Oliver Hudson, Beau Bridges and Carlos Bernard. The CGI effects are pretty decent and although some of it is reminiscent of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, there have been a lot more disastrous disaster films, so if you're a genre fan, you shouldn't be too disappointed.","DOOMSDAY DISASTER.

1,Pet Comforter also,"I originally bought it for the humans in our family. However, while using it, the cats (now older cats) discovered that they liked it too. We have a cat with arthritis, and in the early morning cold hours, she will get up to lay on it anywhere I throw it. I also have a 10 month old kitten, who likes trying to lay on all of them all at once... So, sharing issues aside, it is a great purchase for humans and cats. Wonderful pain reliever. It comes with a cover, however I would recommend the cover be made out of cotton instead of the airplane pillow cover material that it currently does. You cannot easily clean the pad's material, so a cover is necessary. But the cover provided is not comfortable. Perhaps it will be an improvement in future versions. In the meantime, I wish I had put a pillow case over the pads (after heating of course), before giving it to the cats.","Pet Comforter also. I originally bought it for the humans in our family.

1,Gotta love this album,"GREAT Zeppelin. The spotlight songs are Immigrant Song, Friends, Celebration Day, Since I've Been Loving You, and Tangerine. Don't really like Bron-y-Aur stomp, Gallows Pole, and That's the Way. Hats off to (Roy) Harper is bad. REALLY bad! It is kind of funny to listen to every once in a while.","Gotta love this album.

I was pleasently surprised, infact I was very very impressed.The sound is different although not that much and its due mainly to Maxine's departure, but the remaining ladies have done an excellent job of finding a new member, her vocals are, well, Rich and Very Very Satisfying.You get the same feeling after listening to this album as you do when you have a great meal, it's not over-done it's not under-done it's just right!I will definately be listening to this album in years to come, and I recommend it to everyone.","Bliss!.

0,Bottom of the Barrel,"Apart from the somewhat ammusing story where Oliver Queen's son join for a night on the town (a story in which Winick does showcase his gift for non-action stories involving social interaction between two male characters), this whole thing is rather mindless with Winick ripping off both Kevin Smith (the dome over the city created by a demon-summoning rich man = the dome over the Drover Brownstone created by a demon-summoning rich man) and himself (the demons here = the monsters in Straight Shooter). Go reread Quiver instead.","Bottom of the Barrel.

0,Piece of Junk,"After using this thing for at least a year, I am getting ready to remove it and throw it away. It simply won't open cans.

Also, cans with lots of liquid in them will have juices strewn everywhere while it attempts to cut the lids. What a mess! I had an old GE Spacemaker years ago that worked like a dream, but this ""Spacemaker"" is no relative or close kin. It was extremely frustrating at Thanksgiving trying to open many cans.

1,Great for the price.,I bought these when they were deal of the day for around $15. Can't complain about a deal like that. In response to the reviewers who said to order a size up I'd say maybe order up a half size if you like your slippers fairly loose. When I first got mine I thought they would be too small but after wearing them a couple of days they stretch out and I think they run pretty tru to size. I wouldn't pay $50 for them but if I see them for deal of the day again I'll be buying them for all my family.,Great for the price.. I bought these when they were deal of the day for around $15.

Even if you don't have a HDCD decoder in your player.The original cardboard LP sleeve and artwork are reproduced in miniature form. Very cute!Yes-heads - brace yourselves!

1,Classic Horror!!,"First off....I am the biggest fan of Halloween of all time, and I love Halloween III Season of the Witch! It may not have Michael Myers in it, but it still has that John Carpenter innovativness and plot making it a classic. The movie does have its share of blood and gore, but still relies on suspense and carefully planned scares. The cast may be rather low budget, but still manages to pull off a good horror flick. Those who trashed this movie need to open their minds and realize what a classic this is! I highly recommend it!","Classic Horror!!.

1,"Excellent shaver, trimmer needs work",I've recently moved from my trusty Gillette Fusion Power over to this electric and I have been pleasantly surprised. After trying the Braun Pulsonic and finding it a bit rough on my face the Arcitec worked much better (your face may react differently but my chubby mug didn't like the Pulsonic).I have a THICK scruff each morning and the Arcitec ate right through it. It took about a week for the shaver to break-in enough that it got everything on a first or second pass so that was a bit irritating but livable.The trimmer really needs work and practice and that's my only major complaint.,"Excellent shaver, trimmer needs work.

I'd still suggest you get a sizing in person but other than this one the next step is the Trek XL which is $$$$ than this.","Good For Me.

0,So BAD.,"I love John Irving books, really I do. He's one of my favorite authors. But this was just a really awful novel. The story has no likeable characters, the main character is boring and seems to learn nothing from his experiences, the women in the book want nothing more than the protagonist's ""seed"" so that they can impregnante themselves. No one seems believable, or sympathetic, or the least bit interesting. If this book were a party, you would be looking at your watch until you could leave. There were times when Irving himself seemed bored with his story -- rather than SHOW anything, he would just TELL huge chunks of the story, as if he wanted to skip ahead. I hope whatever caused Irving to write this book will go infect someone else instead -- I miss the great author he used to be.","So BAD.. I love John Irving books, really I do.

The story has no likeable characters, the main character is boring and seems to learn nothing from his experiences, the women in the book want nothing more than the protagonist's ""seed"" so that they can impregnante themselves. No one seems believable, or sympathetic, or the least bit interesting. If this book were a party, you would be looking at your watch until you could leave. There were times when Irving himself seemed bored with his story -- rather than SHOW anything, he would just TELL huge chunks of the story, as if he wanted to skip ahead. I hope whatever caused Irving to write this book will go infect someone else instead -- I miss the great author he used to be."

1,"In one word, AMAZING!","I've tried different shapeware before, and nothing has ever worked. I got this on a recommendation and I'm now in love!I have a 30 inch waist, and ""tummy"" problems, when I put this on, my stomach was instantly flatter and I lost 2 inches on my waist! I couldn't believe it! I got the size Medium, so if you're about my size, Medium would be good for you! A large would have been to big. I'm tempted to try a Small though.I also can't believe how comfortable it is, it literally feels like you aren't wearing anything! I thought I wouldn't be able to breath, or bend over, but I can do both very easily! It doesn't ride up when I bend over either.And, as a bonus, I noticed it really felt like it was supporting my back. I have back problems, so I'm all for extra support for my back!I love this and will probably be buying more!","In one word, AMAZING!.

0,Garbage from beginning to end,This is a garbage movie. The only thing worse than the beginning and middle of the movie was the end!

1,Ingenious capture of desperation,"What an intense movie! The whole time I was watching I was leaned forward with my palms sweating! The plot was deliciously unpredictable as well, especially with the ending.Basically the movie involves 9 strangers getting locked into a mansion and are forced to kill each other in order to leave, while the lone survivor is promised 5 million dollars in cash prize. The cast in this movie was amazing, especially Dennis Hopper, who played an Irish catholic priest who seemed to be losing his faith. You really get to know each of the characters well as the movie progresses on too, and as more and more people begin to die off you feel the intensity grow along with it.In my opinion the director really did a good job in showing the power of greed and the savagery of the human nature in this movie. The soundtrack for the movie was also totally awesome, with genres spanning from hip-hop to piano sonatas. It really stands out compared to other films.","Ingenious capture of desperation.

Get me Bodied which has a nice groove to it and has the potential of being released as a single. Unfortunately, thats where i come to a complete hault. Ring the Alarm has some possiblities because of the hot beat....just can't get pass all that screaming. So to sum this CD up is to say sorry Beyonce.

Everyone should buy this CD because this musical and this recording may be discussed forever in the annals of musical theater disasters.

1,Understanding General Semantics,"General Semantics isn't a difficult cluster of concepts to understand; but to those who might have some difficulty with it, Kenneth Keyes Jr makes everything entertainingly crystal clear. Because of the constraints of their culture and language, people tend to develop unscientific and illogical patterns of thought and behavior. Learning the basic principles of General Semantics as presented by this author is the first step in addressing those problems. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in scientific and logical thinking.","Understanding General Semantics.

1,"Good, solid, well-filmed, low-budget western revenge flick","I have to strongly disagree with the other reviewer. This is a very solid low-budget western. Jason Rodriguez wrote the story, directed the movie, and is the lead star. I don't think this set out to be ""Unforgiven"". The locales used in the filming are quite beautiful. I think the acting in the film was quite well done, most of the dialogue has an 1800's western spoken flair to it. The plot is quite good and the characters are memorable. If you're a fan of westerns you'll probably like this movie just as i have. If, however you're looking for a multi-million dollar production...look elsewhere, because this clearly doesn't try to be one as the other reviewer clearly expected.","Good, solid, well-filmed, low-budget western revenge flick.

Having said that, some sections of this book give you that sense of awe at the biological world that Dr. Dawkins is so good at presenting.

Only complaint is that the bed is slightly wider than my mattress (which is a queen size Bergad memory foam mattress...no box springs). As a result, you can see an inch or so of the unpainted bed slats. But maybe my mattress is a bit non-standard, I really don't know. No big deal, the bed sheets cover it up. Anyhow, I like the bed overall.","Good bed for the money. Assembly was pretty easy. The bed (especially the headboard) looks nice and is of a pretty good quality.

0,Really Starting to Slip,"What was beginning in season four continues: the inability of the writers to keep the story innovative and exciting. This season made me cringe AGAIN when CTU was attacked AGAIN by terrorists. The new characters are shallow and are horrible actors (with the exception of Milo-though he is technically a season one character returning). The show has run its course and I think should be nearing its end. The writers have killed off every interesting character by this point except Chloe. Watch through season 3 for sure, after that view at your own risk.Here is the order in my humble opinion.Season 3 - best seasonSeason 1Season 2Season 5Season 4Season 6 - worst season","Really Starting to Slip.

1,Accurate and great customer service from Soehnle,"Pluses1) A very accurate scale2) The object being weighed does not obscure the readout3) Does metric and english...although I rarely use the metric4) Amazing costumer service from Soehnle.....I dropped and broke the glass top while cleaning in it. Soehnle sent a new glass top free of charge and also didn't make us pay shipping!Drawbacks1) I wish I could change the length of the sleep function OR when awakening the scale it would remember what the weight was before it slept. It only takes a little more planning. I prep everything that I need to weigh before starting to weigh so I don't have the problem2) It takes up counter space and can't be stored as easily as some of the flat, planar models.","Accurate and great customer service from Soehnle.

Warner manages to keep his punk sensibilities, for better or for worse.

Entertaining and informative nonetheless.","Punky Zenster.

1,Connery's Last Hurrah to the Eon Bond Series.,"After a one film hiatus, Sean Connery returned one last time to play super agent James Bond in the Eon Bond Series. Connery is back and in fine form as he tracks down some ruthless diamond smugglers out to hold the free world at ransom with a strange new secret weapon. Here is where the Bond series started it's campy 70's silliness, which mars this Bond effort down a notch. Even some of the action sequences fall flat in this one (especially the moon buggy bit). Only the Vegas car chase and the elevator fight stand out. Still ""Plenty"" to enjoy in this one. Jill St. John makes for a sardonic and sensuous love interest as Tiffany Case. One could have wished Natalie's kid sister Lana Wood had a bigger role as Plenty O'Toole, though. You Only Live Twice returnee Charles Gray is the least effective Blofeld in the series, but he has fun with it. Bruce Glover and Putter Smith are hilarious as the two gay assasins, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kid.***1/2 out of *****","Connery's Last Hurrah to the Eon Bond Series..

You can't tighten them without fear of cracking the plastic base (which I did -- and I didn't over tighten either). Once the base cracked at the screws, it's done. It's on it's way to recycling!

By this stage - with almost 60 albums behind them - Tom Clancy was dying of cancer and plays a sad, quiet role in proceedings. But brothers Paddy and Liam are at their brilliant best, as is Makem. Never will you hear such vibrant, energetic talent. The death of Tom in 1990 and Paddy in 1998 brought to an end the reign of the greatest folk band in history. Listen to their rousing rendition of ""The Holy Ground"" and dare tell me I'm wrong. Guthrie may have been the inspiration, but without the Clancy Brothers there would have been no Dylan.

He is up for promotion from time to time, but he would have to move and leave the small town...and he can't leave. Usually M. C. Beaton doesn't develope a lot of characters, but in this book she does! We have suspects everywhere. So it is fun to read this mystery and let in unfold before you. I like this mystery!","A New Detective by M. C. Beaton. I have enjoyed M. C. Beaton's books on Agatha Raisin, but this is a whole different book.

1,Sony 8gb Micro Vault is impressive,"Hi, I have read several bad commentaries about this usb storage device on different websites and all I can say is I love mine !! It is not slow and I think anyone with half a brain would realize that even usb 2.0 h/s transfers will never be nicknamed lightning quick usb!! This tiny thing sure can hold a bunch of info and many mp3's even at 224k kbps. Like around a thousand at that high quality bitrate !! I never realized people are so impatient as to expect instant large file transfers out of any usb storage device !! For the low price you pay for one of these I think you will very content to own one of these miracles of science !!!","Sony 8gb Micro Vault is impressive.

0,"Bad novel, worse editing","The story is fairly typical, but the dialogue is stilted and unbelievable. There are few surprises, and the characters are forced down your throat with ham-handed attempts at empathic situations which end up making you indifferent to their fates.Also, this book was edited by an illiterate person. There are numerous misspellings and the grammar in several parts is extremely sloppy.","Bad novel, worse editing. The story is fairly typical, but the dialogue is stilted and unbelievable.

0,Misty and Reesy are BACK and BETTER than ever...,"...if you enjoyed Misty's and Reesy's antics in ""Scenes from a Sistah"" and ""Gettin' to the Good Part"" you'll love ""Tastes Like Chicken"".The story picks up with Reesy preparing to get married. Only a ""surprise"" guest shows up at the wedding and the nuptials are halted. This is where the drama begins...the story revolves around Reesy who embarks on a trip across county to get away from the madness, Misty and Reesy's parents.I loved the book...my only complaint is to Ms. Files. Don't leave us waiting several years for a sequel. We tend to forget the essential pieces to the story.","Misty and Reesy are BACK and BETTER than ever.... ...if you enjoyed Misty's and Reesy's antics in ""Scenes from a Sistah"" and ""Gettin' to the Good Part"" you'll love ""Tastes Like Chicken"".The story picks up with Reesy preparing to get married.

1,Surprisingly Good,"I've seen a lot of people echoing my opinion that this is a true standout album. It is easy to forget that these are all B-sides since the quality of the songs is as consistant as any of Oasis' album.The Masterplan is a great album to listen to beginning to end since the songs all have a different feel and sound to them.If you don't like Oasis, this album won't change your opinion. If you do like Oasis, The Masterplan probably provides the most quality music per dollar of any Oasis album.","Surprisingly Good.

1,so far so good,"we've been using this mattress with a DaVinci Kalani crib for over 2 months now. So far i like it. It fit very snugly in the crib even at the edges. The mattress is quite firm as we wanted it. The surface though, probably because it is water resistant, is slippery, so when we put a sheet on top of the mattress, unless the sheet is fit very tightly it gets a bit slippery under our baby's feet. would have been good if the surface had more friction.","so far so good. we've been using this mattress with a DaVinci Kalani crib for over 2 months now.

1,DGL-4100 Review,"Initial installation was a snap! Plugged it in, turned it on and it was off and running. Had to update the ROM code to the latest version but that was expected. So far so good. Been using it for a month or so now and it works as advertised. Set it up for a few online games to one computer and Bit torrent to another computer. No game lag as I had before using my Linksys router. This router really works as advertised! The blue lights on the router are pretty cool but since the router is in my room it is like having a night light on with a blue hue. This is the fifth router I have owned for home use in the past four years and it is certainly the best!","DGL-4100 Review. Initial installation was a snap!

1,This is a great learning toy and lots of fun too!!,"My 14mo. old son loves this toy. He received it for Christmas last year and it has been one of his favorites ever since. It was great for tummy time play when he first got it. Now that he's bigger he loves to chase after it and listen to it sing. I know he'll love it as he gets older too. I use it in my preschool classroom, and the children love it. Its been great at helping them recognize their alphabet and helped them learn letter sounds too. This is a great toy, I recommend it to everyone.","This is a great learning toy and lots of fun too!!. My 14mo. old son loves this toy.

0,Don't waste your money or time.,This book has all of the usual defects of books from Kluwer Academic Publishers. Acronyms in the text and terms in equations are not defined. Diagrams have errors. It seems to be a cut and paste job with very little systematic development of the subject. Graphs of CAD program outputs are presented with no or very little comment or discussion. There is one case of a technical error. A mathematical program output which claims to show the effects of amplifier noise figure really illustrates the beneficial effects of dithering data to overcome the effects of finite word length in FFT calculations.,Don't waste your money or time..

0,3 Months and Already Out Of Print????,"Lately Disney is making wrong choices with their shows. Zorro is a well loved series, and very much popular. You'd think that when Disney put this series on dvd, that it would be on sale for 2-4 years or so. I know there is a profit in selling the box set. So why did Disney decided to sell the set for a limited of 30,000??? That makes no sense. The box set came out in Nov 09, and 3-4 months later it's already Out Of Print. Seems pointless to sell the series, and then discontinue it so short of time. Very disappointing.","3 Months and Already Out Of Print????. Lately Disney is making wrong choices with their shows.

1,Dr. Who Second Series ROCKS & is packed with extras!,"I've been watching Dr.Who since Tom Baker was on the show. And, until David Tennent arrived, Tom was definately ""The Doctor"". The second series had to have some of the best, most interesting episodes for this TV show so far. There are also bloopers, a video diary by David Tennant, BBC Dr. Who comercials, audio (and some video) commentary by various writers, directors and actors (including David Tennant and Bille Piper)and, my favorite, a ten minute little nugget that the BBC put together for a charity. It bridges the gap from the last episode in season one (right after The Doctor regenerated) to right before the season two episode where they land in Cardiff for Christmas. It's definately a wonderful DVD set!","Dr. Who Second Series ROCKS & is packed with extras!. I've been watching Dr.Who since Tom Baker was on the show.

0,Just Awful,"I started out hoping for some kind of drama, eventually, but the sickening sweetness was unrelenting. Combined with the fact these people had no business owning a large, strong working-breed dog. Gosh, the trouble they got themselves into -- how cute! Still cute. Forever cute.

1,So far so good,Odd use but I bought this pump to use as a powered dog washing station. Have a dog with a lot (!!) of hair and it usually takes me about an hour to shampoo and rinse him off so needless to say he's usually quite dirty.Got this idea to just make a power washer using a utility pump and its worked out perfectly. The pump seems to be reliable and well made. My only concern has to do with the filter and whether it would hold out hair. I couldn't find out how big the filter is so I ended up wrapping the pump with some women's pantyhose.I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others who need this type of pump.,So far so good.

1,Anti-War Farce Through Science Fiction,"Kurt Vonnuget is one of the most unique writers to emerge in the 2nd half of the 20th century. All of his novels contain a blend of sarcasm, dark humor satire, criticism of society's many hypocricies, and the exposure of human foibles/shortcomings, enhanced by greed and resource mongering. In Slaughter-House Five Vonnuget uses the perspective of a time-traveling WWII veteran, Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnuget witnessed the Dresden firebombings, as the medium to expose his view of the short-comings of human conflict. The novel is a tremendous exposure and criticism on the brutality and mind-numbing savagery of war. Even for survivors, life becomes a tale of shell-shocked incongruencies that plague the psycho-somatic foundation of a person, as illustrated in our protoganist, Billy Pilgrim. This is one of the great anti-war novels written in a completely unique format and structure.","Anti-War Farce Through Science Fiction.

The melding of fantasy and fact, past and present, is quite adept...with just a touch of spiritualism for those who like to contemplate further than what appears right before their eyes.It reminded me of The Talisman, yet the Arthurian theme here carries a noble energy to the plot that had me wanting to raise a sword with the Knights of the Round Table.relax for a few days at home with this one, when you just want to take a load off...","A neat little job !.

0,Do not buy this CD!! It is not Vangelis!!!,"If you're wondering why this CD is so cheap, the answer is that it is rubbish!! These tracks are not from the orginal recordings produced by Vangelis himself. They are played by what sounds like an untalented 10 year old plinking out the tunes on a cheap keyboard. The result is so bad that the CD doesn't deserve to bare Vangelis' name! This CD is an utter insult to one of the most brilliant composers of all time and should be avoided at all costs!!","Do not buy this CD!! It is not Vangelis!!!.

0,What is LEGO thinking?,"Every kid interested in Star Wars and LEGOs wants this because of the cool minifigure. However, it is a 22 minute cartoon so why go to the expense of including Blu-Ray and a DVD discs when a cheaper DVD disc would be sufficient. Even at half the price, which is what you'll pay at a local mega-store (starts with a W), it isn't worth the price. So now parents have to explain to kids why it isn't worth it.","What is LEGO thinking?. Every kid interested in Star Wars and LEGOs wants this because of the cool minifigure.

The toys (Butterflies) could have been little more attractive and the swing could have been little less noisy.

1,swept away!,"Here it is, the ultimate Survivor episode, a thinking person's adventure tale. The writing hooked me with the very first sentence, ""The wound was their path"", and what a path it becomes, full of twists and surprises and Nathan Lee's heart full of hope. I've never seen a book like this, with such wild premises that seem to have no connection, but which by the end are woven into a single thread. On the one hand Year Zero is a novel about the virus from hell, the big extinction event that we humans think can't happen to us. Then there's the cloning of human lab rats that has echoes of Frankenstein and Brave New World. Nathan Lee's escape through the Himalayas is almost a story in itself, but Long keeps on spinning his web, and somehow, amazingly ties it all together in the end. I started describing the story to a friend, then just stopped and gave her the book to read for herself. This one defies simple description. All I can say is, dive in and get swept away.","swept away!. Here it is, the ultimate Survivor episode, a thinking person's adventure tale.

I was also looking forward to being able to cart it around with all my other books via my Kindle.Unfortunately, like so many other language books, this one is not ported well. In fact, I would have to say it's worse than many others, as the tables are put together in image files which are too small to read, even when expanded.I'm still waiting for a publisher of this type of book to get serious about the Kindle and really translate their work over to a format that the reader can use.","Kindle Version Unusable.

1,Cute Plot -- Acceptable Cast,"Despite being hampered by a lack of any real romantic opposite in a romantic comedy, Sandra Bullock manages to pull off an enjoyable performance. The plot is rather outrageous at times, but it works. The cast manages to pull off rather spoofy but humorous situations, so there are a number of laughable moments. Again, the movie could have been improved with a believable love interest, but it is still worth watching, just for the fun of it.","Cute Plot -- Acceptable Cast.

1,Dark and Chilling Tale,"I've read all of Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus tales. Thus, I've spent many hours with John Rebus, and his deep, dark, intensity. His world of pain and loss is usually Edinburgh where the city becomes a living being as conscious and present as Rebus himself-and the shadows that fill his life. In Tooth and Nail, we are thrust with Rebus into an alien land, London, and much more into the alien mind of the murderer. The insanity within the serial killer is disconcerting, creating anixity within us as we read the words. No longer are we curled up with a good book reading about paper characters. We become no more safe from the demons of imagination than the do victims in the novel. But Mr. Rankin not only chills us, he saves us, at least for the moment. I could not bear such unease if it wasn't for the realization that Inspector Rebus will succeed in the end, at least enough for me to sleep without nightmares . . bravo, Mr. Rankin. You are an artist.","Dark and Chilling Tale. I've read all of Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus tales. Thus, I've spent many hours with John Rebus, and his deep, dark, intensity.

0,A dissapointment,"The author writes well, but nothing he says is so profound or comforting.

0,Coulda been...but lacks polish,"A good cast starring Milla Jovovich and the venerable Will Patton.Half way through you're OK. But then it gets weaker and weaker until you find no end to ""The End"". At least not in the traditional Horror, Sci-fi genre. It's as if the director ran out of money and used a lenghty on-screen script to finalize his endeavor. The audience is left hanging with quite a bit of unresolved situations previously introduced. No resolve!The cinematography is awfully pale considering the location.The sets are droll.If you're going to do a ""true story"" piece you had better be right on or at least introduce a bit more melodrama to even the score.","Coulda been...but lacks polish.

1,"Much better than Hatchet, doesn't take much","This film for me was a vast improvement on Hatchet-I haven't seen Spiral yet. I know Kevin Zegers from the original Air Bud, and I can honestly say he was just as good in this, writer/director Adam Green from Hatchet made a good script, with genuine fear, a creepy atmosphere, and likable charecters, overall. I was impressed with Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell as well. This film should NOT be put in the horror genre, more like a suspence/survival thriller. Independant filmmaking may well be the only way Hollywood can still come up with semi-new ideas. The slasher killer tactic is getting tired, re-makes are getting too predictable, the revenge storyline is getting very tired. But I've known that some people still have some new ideas, the only problem is, will audiences want to see them?I guess we'll see.","Much better than Hatchet, doesn't take much.

1,Great for your skin!,"My skin was dry with the winter, felt rough and looked washed out. I wanted something to renew it so bought this to ""regenerate"" it during the day. I'd read a dermatologist say that the big companies (like Olay) have great products for the $$$ because they are so big and do so much research. You don't have to pay boutique prices for a boutique skin care item, because the big companies have great products. They wouldn't sell so much if the products weren't good. I put this on daily, and then got Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir to wear at night. When I work at home during the day, I put this product on during the day and let it go to work. My skin was notably softer, smoother, less dry, and healthier looking within a few days. It removed some of the dead skin cells I believe and looks younger. I'm going to order some of Olay's eye care items, as I was so pleased with this.","Great for your skin!. My skin was dry with the winter, felt rough and looked washed out.

0,Not as good as this Amazon rating suggests...,"I'm really surprised to see this sequel rated so highly. Although Carpenter penned the screenplay, it was very much lacking from his suspenseful direction.This entry suffers from not enough Jamie Lee Curtis, a different guy playing Michael Meyers(in a different physical-style) and a mish-mashed storyline that barely plods along. All of the killings happen quickly and without any of the buildup of suspense that made the first movie such a classic.Fans of the first will probably want to see this but it's strictly uninspired B-movie material all the way around. I think Esacape from L.A. was a more worthy sequel, and that's not sayin' much...","Not as good as this Amazon rating suggests.... I'm really surprised to see this sequel rated so highly.

0,Unreliable with Cyberhome recorder,"I've recorded about 120 DVD's on my Cyberhome recorder. In the past, I've used Ritek, Imation and TDK blank disks with no problems. I've now used about 30 of this stack of 100 Memorex DVD's. Two could not be formatted by the Cyberhome recorder and had to be trashed. Two others recorded, seemed okay, but then could not be finalized, which means I can play them on the Cyberhome but never play them on a PC and who knows what else. That's more than a 10% failure rate. Overall, with the price for these being so reasonable, I'm using the Memorex to record things that if I have finalization problems, I won't be too upset, and using other brands for more important recordings - - but I certainly won't buy them again.","Unreliable with Cyberhome recorder.

1,Nice for the Price,"Nice little blo/vac. Gave it four stars, because suction is not quite as awesome as I had hoped. Blower is fantastic. I use it in-between dustings to remove dog hair from furniture. Great for removing dust accumulated on ceiling and floor fans. Does a really good job of cleaning blades and grates as well. I use it to clean my laptop and other hard to reach places that dust accumulates. I just blow the dog hair, dust, lint build up, etc. to the floor and vacuum it away. Great cheat for people with lots if whatnots and little time to dust. Time saver. Some reviews have complained of the smell. To me, it is just a light machine oil smell that only lingers for about a half hour. A quick spray of air freshener does the trick for me.","Nice for the Price. Nice little blo/vac.

1,A Great British Pop Band Album,"I think this is a great CD. I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it. This album is a nice change from most modern pop/rock bands since this band is minus a guitar player. The band has a more delicate pop/rock sound with only vocals, drums, and a piano. The sound of the piano in ""Somewhere Only We Know"" is enchanting. Not only is their music pleasing, but the lyrics in their songs are heartfelt and catchy. The vocals of leader singer Tom Chaplin are captivating. He is able to hit a wide range of keys, even the high ones like in ""She Has No Time"".As for sounding similar to the band Coldplay, I believe Keane has their own unique sound. But, if you enjoy bands like Coldplay, Radiohead, and Oasis, then I would recommend this CD.","A Great British Pop Band Album. I think this is a great CD.

0,Poor instruction,"The instructor is high energy and likeable, but the actual instruction is very poor.

For example, the salsa segment never tells you that the salsa count is 1, 2, 3 (hold), 5, 6, 7 (hold). And then cha-cha steps are thrown in to the salsa segment. Messed up.This might be a fun aerobics DVD for someone who didn't care about actual dance moves. I was hoping for more.","Poor instruction.

Then, every few songs or so, when you're skipping ahead or back, it makes this BRRR! sound followed by a high-pitched whine, and takes several seconds before proceeding to the next song.I'm extremely sorry I purchased this device, and I would strongly advise others from making the same mistake.","Worst. iPod Player.

0,Absolutely HORRIFIC!,Avoid this game at all costs. I was one of the first to buy this game because of how much I loved GH 2. Too bad this game made me want to avoid all future GH series. This game has 2 maybe 3 songs that are actually fun to play. All of the songs are boring 90% of them I had no idea what they were or why they were chosen for the game. I got 5 gold stars on almost every song my first time around so I knew this 80's game was worthless so I sold it on ebay the next day. It was not fun to play YOU CAN'T BUY MORE SONGS and it's all the same characters just in stupid outfits. Save your money.,Absolutely HORRIFIC!. Avoid this game at all costs.

0,BEWARE. May be very uncomfortable to use.,"The product is well made and goes together easily. Unfortunately, if you have a cast that goes up almost to the knee, all the weight of your body will press against the cast and into your leg below the knee. This makes the Knee Walker extremely uncomfortable after a few minutes. Try this:1. Put a folding chair with a padded seat in front of you.2. Bend your ""bad"" leg so the cast is horizontal.3. Place all your weight on the cast with the chair underneath.If this doesn't cause any discomfort, the knee walker will probably work OK for you. Thick carpet, going backwards and tight spaces (constantly lifting it to change directions) are annoying, but if it weren't for the extreme pressure just below my knee, I could live with it.","BEWARE.

0,Cuts well but engine doesn't last,"I bought the Poulan Pro 2 Summer's ago, and it ran for most of the season then it started surging and burning oil. I brought it to the local lawnmower repair shop, and he repaired the carburetor, replaced the spark plug and filter. It ran well for the second season. Now it's starting to surge and sputter after one month into the third season. I always run the engine until the fuel runs out before I store it at the end of the season. Would recommend you avoid this model.","Cuts well but engine doesn't last. I bought the Poulan Pro 2 Summer's ago, and it ran for most of the season then it started surging and burning oil.

0,Disappointing ...,"I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing. The book was interesting enough but not very useful. I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle.","Disappointing ....

Well, I should have left well enough alone. Within a week of using this product I was so bound up and gained 2 lbs. I was in so much pain that I was unable to continue using it. Within 3 days after discontinuing use, my system started getting back to normal and I felt so much better. I wanted to return the unused portion, I bought enough for 60 days, but apparently I threw away the packing slip and that is needed for a refund. So much money spent that is completely wasted. I'm happy for those that this product did work for but apparently, it wasn't for me.","Very dissappointing. I purchased this product with such high hopes.

1,Everything you've been looking for...and then some!!,"It seems as if almost every book Stephen King has ever written ties in, somehow, somewhere, with this series. Eyes of the Dragon, Insomnia, The Stand, The Talisman (his combined work with Peter Straub), and at least one of his short stories concerning 'Salem's Lot all have a place in this meticulously crafted universe. If you've ever read King, you're already a fan, but this series is, beyond a doubt, his greatest accomplishment. Like some other readers I've been suffering anxiety attacks while waiting for the 4th book in the series, thinking some disaster would befall King and the series would be left unfinished. Now that I've read the latest volume (3 times) I'm beginning to fiend all over again. I can't wait for the 5th book, and sadly I know it will probably be a long time coming, but will definately be worth the wait. This series is truly a work of art.","Everything you've been looking for...and then some!!.

1,Excellent Product!,This is the first BP monitor I have owned. I did much research beforehand. All operates as advertised. I cannot verify it's accuracy but from comparison to other machines it seems to be on point. It's easy to use and fast. I have not utilized the machine on battery power but assume it would operate just fine as the AC current. The mean averaging of the past 3 usages is especially helpful as you get a very accurate reading overall. I heartily recommend this device.,Excellent Product!.

1,One of the BEST games ever made . . . and in English!,"Snatcher for the Sega CD is arguably the best version of one of the best games ever made, and the only one available in English. Although I already owned the PC Engine version, I was pleasantly surprised to discover this one, with some extra sequences and a more fully fleshed out ending.Some might argue that this game is average fare, what with the ""antiquated"" interface and Blade Runner/Terminator/Bubblegum Crisis influences, but when it comes to atmosphere, this game is tough to beat! The music and visuals blend together perfectly to produce genuine moments of fear and anticipation in the player. It's an interactive story that sucks you in so deeply, that even after you are done, you will want to live though it again and again! A masterpiece of storytelling and gaming!The intro: [...]","One of the BEST games ever made . . . and in English!.

1,Rarities from the Malaco vaults.,"This compilation focuses almost exclusively on rarities and previously unreleased tracks from the Malaco label's vaults. Malaco, of course, is probably one of the very few labels still recording and releasing REAL Soul music and this collection gives you a good overview of the label's sound an d style. The songs by Sam Dees, Dorothy Moore, The Patterson Twins, Tommy Tate, Anita Mitchell, Charles Warren and Carolyn Faye are my favorites but the whole CD is very good. Both ballads and more uptempo tracks are featured here.","Rarities from the Malaco vaults..

1,I now remember why I rushed home from school,"Every weekday at 3:30, the local channel ran this show. I remember the ship with the large hole in the front that could do some nasty damage to anyone in its path. I also remember falling in love with the sci fi genra because of this show. Now I get the video of the second series which got cut off when I was a kid. This set is what I had dreamed of having when a kid. The entirety of each series in a collection as opposed to seperate video tapes with two episodes each. Each of the collection tapes have four episodes or more each. As I watched I remembered how well developed the characters were, which is quite a bit for a cartoon, in fact I forgot I was watching a cartoon, this is probably due to the increadible story of this saga. I highly recomend this for anyone that grew up with this cartoon.","I now remember why I rushed home from school. Every weekday at 3:30, the local channel ran this show.

0,Nothing like the original,"I have a substantial set of Desert Rose made in California that I inherited from a family member. My original set is absolutely beautiful. The craftsmanship is amazing. Each piece has wonderful details in both the texture of the ceramic and the hand painting.This piece is made in China and is NOTHING like the original. The butter dish is clumsy and bulbous. The top of the butter dish does not fit neatly into the bottom but rather flops around. The ""rose"" on top is simply a blob. The painting lacks any kind of detail found in the original. When placed side by side to the original they don't even look like they are part of the same set. Save yourself the disappointment and look for an original replacement piece with a USA backstamp.","Nothing like the original.

1,Good challenging start at Oragami ... Well worth it,"I purchased this for my 7 year old. The book has some easy start Origami (swan, fish, etc.) and then moves toward others that are more challenging (water bomb, frog, etc.). She really enjoys it. I can see more Origami in her future :) (NOTE: it does not include paper, so I purchasedOrigami Paper Traditional Prints 8 1/4"" 49 Sheets).","Good challenging start at Oragami ... Well worth it.

1,GONE IS THE ROMANCE,"Okay, folks...clearly this movie was made for another time, another decade, another life....it's 1961, and Ross Hunter has churned out these weepers for years now. The audiences wanted a love affair that appeared ""heavenly,"" ""bad,"" etc. Sure John Gavin is a cad..he never bothers to tell Susan Hayward that he's married and has two children. Sure, Vera Miles is the ultimate bitch---cold, calculating, unloving, and an alcoholic to boot. Sure Gavin should get a divorce in spite of Miles' threats. Sure the kids are hokey and unconvincing actors. Too many gowns, too many starry eyed I love yous...but isn't this what movies like BACK STREET are all about. No matter what, one can't deny the tissue factor when hunky Gavin lies dying in his bed, and when the children ask if they can visit Rae.This isn't cinematic history folks..it's just a glitzy and moving tearjerker, which will probably stand the test of time.","GONE IS THE ROMANCE.

1,Passionate Perfection,"This is the best recording I have listened to in years, and I will never get tired of it. It is a classic in all respects. Not only does it include all my favorite styles of music-- Celtic, rock, classical, worship-- but it enlists my entire being to take it all in. Genius of composition and virtuousity of performance come together to express a wide range of thoughts and moods in what is a musical experience that is rare indeed. Layers of beautiful instrumentation, fascinating rhythmical textures, angelic voices and mystical lyrics all fabulously work together to showcase what I consider the best feature of all: Bainbridge's soaring electric guitar work. No one sings as he does. ""Veil of Gossamer"" is a masterpiece.","Passionate Perfection. This is the best recording I have listened to in years, and I will never get tired of it.

1,Great normal looking girls,"I love this title, the music is so-so but atleast it isn't anoying like most of the time. The girls are normal looking, with a few silicon here and there. What sells this dvd is how cheerful some (not all) of the models are when they are dancing. The camera moves at different angles, sometimes giving a top or bottom view in just the perfect way. I wish the producer would consentrate more on the setting around the models a bit more instead of fixing a camera on a model for 10 mins. Those 10 mins can be charming or boring if the model are not of your type.","Great normal looking girls. I love this title, the music is so-so but atleast it isn't anoying like most of the time.

1,A real workhorse.,"This is an excellent sander.

Further, some photos are included of his life, and these will also show the viewer what helped shape the ideas in his work.Included are some of his more popular works, but you will not find the alien from the movie (although you will find sketches for House Harkonnen from Dune).If you are a science fiction or horror fan who is thinking of learning more about art and the artist behind the work, then this would make a fine coffee table addition.","The artist behind the sci-fi.

That's basically all NIGHT CREATURE accomplishes.

The credits even state in this 2006 issue that it was mastered by Bob Ludwig in 1996. Yes, John Kalodner said in an interview that he and Steve Perry were updating the Journey albums to 2006 audio standards, but unfortunately that was not true. The packaging is new, but if you're an audiophile looking for updated sound, you're not going to find it, so save your money. I give one star for the pure silliness in reissuing the exact same disc under the illusion it is a sonic upgrade.","NOT REMASTERED.

0,Just go ahead and spend the money on Band-Aids,"This gadget is nice ... conceptually. However, in execution, it is flimsy, very difficult to use, the blades are almost impossible to change out, and it is an overall waste of money. It works ok for easy things like carrots and cucumbers, but you could slice those just as easily by hand. On the more difficult items (such as potatoes or other dense vegetables), the slices get jammed in the opening and you end up cutting your fingers fairly frequently. It just isn't worth spending [money] for.","Just go ahead and spend the money on Band-Aids. This gadget is nice ... conceptually.

1,Very good book that was hard to put down,The only reason that this book didn't receive the full 5 stars from me is due to the plot. If the plot was a little deeper it would have been a better read. The author could have fleshed out the relationships a little better so that the reader cared more about the side characters.The concepts put forth such as the Judges and the training ground were good. The description of the world and how it works was rich with detail.

1,"Good, but a little incomplete","This is a good book for beginners, though it may leap into the skill of reading music a little quickly. It does cover many of the essential skills needed to begin playing trumpet, like fingerings, posture, note-reading exercises, and most importantly, a recording so students can hear some of what is being played (not all items in the book are on the CD). That being said, more explanation of some techniques would be helpful, as well as ways to practice, recordings to listen to, and maybe even some history.

1,"Id give it five stars, if only it were on DVD","I know, I know... It's been said before. But I just wanted to reiterate that this is a movie that NEEDS a full on DVD. Hopefully, someone at Universal will read these reviews and figure out that they could make a buck by distrubitng this in DVD format. The movie itself is a great comedy, with well developed charecters (sometimes over the top, but clearly this is intentional), and the dialogue is just hilarious. This movie is a great example of what a good script combined with excellent casting can do for charecter interaction. It's always nice when you can see that the writer, director, and actors are all on the same sheet of music. Watch this movie if you want to laugh. If you don't like laughing, then I suggest you seek therapy. Oh, and watch this movie when you're cured.","Id give it five stars, if only it were on DVD. I know, I know... It's been said before.

0,Pop-out bottom slips and doesn't work well for liquidy tarts,"I was happy with the look and feel of this pan when I received it. However, when I actually tried to use it, I found several issues with the construction.The pop-out bottom, which is advertised as making cleaning and serving easy, kept slipping when I was handling the pan. The lack of a grip makes carrying this pan a bit hard. If you grip the bottom, the pop-out piece may slip and shift the contents and even break the crust.This pan is not at all suitable for pies and tarts with a porous crust and liquidy filling.

1,Nice Poker Set,"This is a nice poker set for both serious and not so serious poker players. The chips are pretty nice, but you can see mold marks on some of them, so they arent perfect. However, I dont know who that would matter to, it didn't matter to me. The case seems like its strong, but the hinges seem to not quite open all the way. The hinges on the case are my biggest gripe, but they aren't terrible. Also the velvet like texture inside the case rubs off a bit. All in all, though, the chips are weighted nicely, the whole set seems sturdy, its incredibly heavy. For the price, you cant go wrong. Its fun to play with, and easy to clean up, and its not worth buying a more expensive one, this one is good.","Nice Poker Set.

Most of the time it fails to measure your weight (returns with the result of ERR).

1,Pretty Good So Far,"Makes a great crust. Like almost all other bread machines, including the extinct Williams Sonama's, the whole grains do not knead well. I find myself pulling the mass of dough out of the machine and hand-kneading, then adding more liquid and tossing it back in. The sour dough white bread I made last night came out perfectly - albeit I had to ""babysit"" while kneading. This is a decent non-commercial machine. I'd rather pay more for a really powerful motor for the kneading, however.","Pretty Good So Far. Makes a great crust.

1,An appropriately thought-provoking read for any age,"The beauty of this book is that it is pushing people to grapple with the ways that any society could limit itself to ignorance, while not actually pointing the finger of blame at any wizard behind the curtain. Not only is the story epic and brief, making it perfect for younger or simply impatient readers; but it is beautifully crafted. As you move from one line to the next, you will find it hard to foresee whether the next feeling it stirs within you will be shock, awe, comfort, disgust, and so on. This is a daring little story, aimed at the big enemy we could prove to be for ourselves. Buy one for everyone you know who isn't afraid to face the darkness with both eyes open!","An appropriately thought-provoking read for any age.

I just wanted to know how the vocabulary builder helps an average english speaking adult, like myself.I tried the CD 5, a vocabulary builder. I realized it was for real rookies (read: grade 1 kids). The flash cards had cards for such mundane words like: eating, drinking, supermarket, trees etc... hope you are getting the drift. At about 200 words/flash cards maximum - taught through 9 different entry points, the content doesn't justify 600+MB of space it occupied on the CD (Remember Microsoft Encarta originally came in 1 CD). Amazing is that how they wasted valuable space to store .wav files for nearly 3 dozen languages to teach from! As noted by other reviewers, this is a hotchpotch collection.

1,Useful,"It's a wonderful reference book for anyone who knows a little Greek and wants to read NT in the language it was written in. It provides translation for almost EVERY word apart from simple ones. This way one can basically try to read NT without any dictionary even during an elementary course.The book is however something more than just a contextual dictionary. It contains also some elements of a grammatical commentary. For example, I learned from it that the form 'pros to' in 'blepon gynaika pros to epithymesai auten' (Mt 5:28) may render a Semitic construction with force of gerund ('lusting', 'with lust').The edition is Catholic. If you're not Catholic yourself, don't worry. It's still something you should have in your personal library. The book doesn't seem to have any ideological bias. It represents a pure linguistic approach.","Useful. It's a wonderful reference book for anyone who knows a little Greek and wants to read NT in the language it was written in.

0,Very difficult and hard-to-follow approach,"I had no idea about French when I first bought this tape, and after I listened to the first tape I still had no idea about French! It is impossible to learn French from these tapes! I spent two days listening to Lesson 1 trying to grasp its content, but it was very difficult. New words are introduced without explaining their meanings, they talk very fast, basic concepts are ignored, and the exercises are useless! After spending almost a month trying to learn from the tapes I decided to enroll in French classes. After a month now I am the best student so far and I can initiate basic conversations. I guess this means that the problem doesn't lie within me, it's with those tapes. I did however benefit from learning a few new French words, but that is not worth the cost at all.","Very difficult and hard-to-follow approach.

Earlier I had a Sony DCR TRV140, which was way better than this camcorder.This camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price. One easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom. Most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors.

But, in some ways, it seems like it is an never ending cycle for everyone except maybe Clare. I think you should read it, and find out for yourself all the twist and turns.

0,Forced,"The hook to this book is incredible. I read the first few pages and knew I needed to read the rest. The crimes are interesting at first. Unfortunately, the book as a whole is not good. The writing, especially the dialogue, is overdone. The insane brother is unnecessary and annoying. Most of the plot is taken up by the protagonist melodramatically caring for his alcoholic ladyfriend, rather than doing any actual sleuthing.Thriller isn't my favorite genre, so maybe those who have a soft spot for thrillers will enjoy this more than I did. I've definitely read thrillers worse than this one, I would chose this over a lot of Patterson's books, for example. And I think Kerley has promise, given that this was his first novel. Some thoughtful editing would've gone a long way to tone down the excessive drama and help Kerley's ideas shine.","Forced. The hook to this book is incredible.

1,Outstanding,"I have read this book multiple times and find myself falling even deeper in love with it each time. Margaret could have taken a lot of liberties with this book but she doesn't. She certainly has done her research.The characters practically jump off the pages. The more you get to know them, the more you adore them. Even the most detail of descriptions is not enough. You find yourself wanting more and more.If there is one thing I didn't particularly like is how modern she wrote Cleopatra. She sugar coated her morals and point of view.It would have been a lot more interesting if she had given us the Cleopatra who is widely believed to have murdered her brother. It would have been a challenge that I guess she wasn't ready to take. Shame, really.","Outstanding. I have read this book multiple times and find myself falling even deeper in love with it each time.

I'll never forget the time I first played through much of his Phantom of the Opera. I started laughing so hysterically at its crappiness and total lack of inspiration, I rolled off the bench to the floor to the amusement of several singers. The new Phantom score by Claude Michel Schonberg is no masterpiece, but it's loads better then Webber's feeble attempt. I rank this Requiem as the worst ever attempted. If I was the composer, I'd be ashamed to put my name to it.

0,"A ""Best Of"" No-No","Consolidating the accomplishments of one of the greatest bands in rock 'n' roll history onto one CD is criminal. Rhino Records does a great job with their ""Complete Greatest Hits,"" etc., but this collection is incomplete, misrepresentative, and poorly arranged. Songs like ""Doolin' Dalton"" make the cut, but ""In the City"" (which, for some reason, was not on the second Greatest Hits collection) is again overlooked. Admittedly, the Eagles have had some strange collections (""After the Thrill is Gone"" being included on the second Greatest Hits despite its 1975 release). So, because my review has been as helter-skelter as the arrangement of tunes on this CD, I will leave you with the recommendation of buying the individual albums or Greatest Hits collections.","A ""Best Of"" No-No. Consolidating the accomplishments of one of the greatest bands in rock 'n' roll history onto one CD is criminal.

1,"Great seat, works fine, but pad and base should lock together","This seat works fine, and the colors/pictures are great. The handles on the side help prevent kids from grabbing toilet seat. It was a good idea to allow the cusion part to be removable for cleaning. HOWEVER, there should be a locking mechanism (flip tab, thumb screw, or other) to keep the pad on the plastic part of the seat. It stays on fine when in use, but when we travel & I put put the seat in a grocery bag or backpack, the padded part sometimes detaches from base and requires you to put it back together before putting on toilet. Not great if you've been using it that day. The padded part could also come loose and fall into toilet water as it's being place on seat, depending on how clumsy you might be.Overall, happy with product and design. Have had no problem with detaching seat pad, just wish it had option to secure it to plastic base.","Great seat, works fine, but pad and base should lock together.

1,Every teen wants one,"I took a lot of flack for buying my 16 year old one with her first car. She put it right up there on the dashboard. My religious friends thought it was blasphemous.

0,Unexpectedly bad!,"Ms. Foster introduces several romance themes into this book, but none of them work. First, the idea of a tough female mercenary leading a daring rescue in Central America is a good idea; but Ray isn't so tough except for knowing some martial arts and the rescue isn't very dangerous.

Second, we already know from the cover of the book (notice the stork) that Ray turns up pregnant, which I don't mind in a story; but it was not ""unexpected.""

In any case, they aren't even close.UPDATE: after some research it looks like these are meant for the convertible only. If that's the case, the choosing tool and description need updated. I ordered the EUR1204s so I'll see how that goes.UPDATE #2: I finally installed the EUR1204s which fit sort of as long as you have a grinder. The inside shoes do not fit and need to be reshapped to be installed, so I guess they really don't fit. The shoes are larger than stock and hang over the inside rim of the rotor. I kept the OEM shoes and will take them to a local shop and check the fit next time I need shoes.","Does not fit my mini. I ordered these for a 2007 base mini and they don't fit.

0,Suction cups suck... in a bad way.,"I purchased a two-pack of these suction cup fender straps. I'm now down to one as the other is probably well on its way to the Atlantic Ocean about now (along with the fender). Thought it was a great idea, but it just didn't work out. I applied the suction cups to a clean, smooth (gel coat) surface, expecting it to hold... and it did, for about 15 minutes, then was gone. I removed the survivor and secured the fender the traditional way, with a line and cleat. To be fair, the water was pretty choppy due to a bunch of jet-skis creating unwelcome wakes. The boat was beating against the dock pretty good. But, a traditionally secured fender would have survived the punishment.","Suction cups suck... in a bad way..

And, that's saying something. I have to finish books. It's the OCD in me. I hate an unfinished book. But, this was just painful. I couldn't do it. Even the writing was different.

0,"Great idea, poor design","I bought this controller as well as a San Diego Chargers wireless controller for both my kids for Christmas 06. All my anticipated excitement was soon squashed by the poor design of the battery compartment. It stacks the AAA batteries in a pyramid, 2 on the base with the 3rd on top. The 3rd battery constantly pops out and is very difficult to keep in. The compartment door itself does not stay closed either further aggrevating the situation. It seems those guys down at Mad Catz could design this with a rechargable battery and docking station. They say they redesigned newer controllers without the vibrating feature to save battery power. Should have spent that R&D time redesigning the battery compartment issue. Another issue is that the controller symbols do not light up, and if they did, it would be an added bonus. All and all a great idea, just needs some tweaking...","Great idea, poor design. I bought this controller as well as a San Diego Chargers wireless controller for both my kids for Christmas 06.

1,An excellent choice for those in need of prosthetic inserts.,"It's hard to find the right shoe when you use a prosthetic insert, short of having one custom made. But the Pedwalker's two removable sole inserts create adequate depth for the device. The broad rounded toe fits a standard insert. The scalloped sides keeps the ankle free (useful on those ""swelling"" days). The Velcro closure is especially useful for neuropathic (i.e., numbed) or arthritic fingers. Not the best winter shoe, since in winter you want the ankle covered, but a good indoor and good-weather shoe.","An excellent choice for those in need of prosthetic inserts..

0,First effort as a director fails miserably,"""Chandler"" is a film with a terrific cast - Warren Oates, Charles McGraw, Gloria Grahame, Royal Dano, Scatman Crothers, Richard Loo, Mitch Ryan - but it never gets off the ground.

It was always several degrees off. I emailed Vicks and they told me I must not be doing it properly. I read, reread and reread the directions and believe me, I did it just right and it did not work. This is a great idea, but not dependable at all.","Great Idea! Bad Product!. My son had RSV 2 times so I had to take his temperature regularly.

0,Why not just read the original?,"I loved Bacheolo's art in this book. Really good stuff. Again Millar's poor writing of villains shows. Proteus just didn't have an ""umph"" behind him. Though he did get in his required body count (is it just me or do villains now aday have to kill like 300+ people an issue? Is it like a requirement to get their villain's license?). I will give Millar points for having Proteus being Xavier's son.Still, over all, I wasn't as impressed with this book as I was Tomorrow People or even Return to Weapon-X. I think Millar is running out of steam. If you want a good telling of the Proteus Saga go pick up the original Claremont/Byrne one, it's worth it.","Why not just read the original?.

0,"Good Effort, Pathetic Product","It was a truly good effort in talking about children with special needs, but this book is not well written. The grammar and spelling are not great, and the sentence structure is very childish. In addition, there is not much psychological information in this book. As a counselor, I was hoping that this would be a good memoir, but also that people could learn from this family's experience. Instead, there are glossed over life stories and ""self defined"" ideas of psychiatric disorders. While I'm sure it was written with good intentions, this book was severely disappointing.","Good Effort, Pathetic Product.

0,"Unfortunately, I agree with all the bad reviews...","Well, I read the reviews and still purchased the set. Shame on me. I was hoping we would be one of the lucky ones to get a good set but we didn't. Not only was it terribly difficult to put together (ours seemed to actually have two incorrect numbers) but it was flimsy and didn't really work at all. The track is much to wobbly to withstand any real momentum that the car gets and Lightning didn't make it around the top of the set even ONE time. Some of the pieces never really clicked properly either - very poorly designed. I also didn't test it until tonight (just 6 days BEFORE Christmas - again, shame on me) so now I have to figure out what to get as the ""big"" present. Hopefully, I can still get a refund since I waited so long to test it. We definitely received one of the defective sets.","Unfortunately, I agree with all the bad reviews....

0,"Bertie needs counseling, not a dog","A young boy named Bertie has an unhealthy fixation on the color BLUE. He soon extends this obsession to a pet. We witness imaginative play where Bertie hallucinates that he is petting, feeding, and walking his blue dog, even dragging the leash and collar along the ground. But since ""pretend dogs don't fetch sticks,"" Bertie must take his psychosis to the next level: now he *is* a blue dog. He barks like a dog, eats sticks, even scratches himself!Act II reveals Bertie to be the lucky recipient of a real dog. Yet he almost sinks into depression--sobbing into his hands and subsequently curling up into the fetal position--when it turns out to be a beautiful, spotted, black and white (but not BLUE) dog.Thankfully, a sudden inspiration allows the dog to be BLUE in name if nothing else, and everyone lived happily ever after.

0,"Review for ""Jaguar""","I originally purchased this DVD because of the other good reviews. I was very disappointed because there was not much footage of jaguars, nor was much research presented. Rather, this was a documentary of the jaguar researcher. You hear about his troubled childhood, you meet his mentor, you meet his wife and children, you see him in the hospital being treated for cancer, and you see his entire life story, etc. etc. It's not this this information is not interesting, but I wanted to see a nature documentary, and this essentially is a biography on a scientist. I would say less than 1/3 of the DVD shows actual footage of jaguars. If you want to see a pure nature documentary, do not waste your money on this.","Review for ""Jaguar"".

1,Very good for beginners,"Being new to the 3d rendering world I have found this to be a great product. Cheap and won't kill your wallet like others, Amorphium Pro 1.1 does a great job not only allowing you to easily create 3d modles, but allows for importing Bryce. I was always intersted in creating 3d mecha (as A Sci-fi buff) and Amphorium did not disappoint. Amorphium did allow me to get a foot of understanding of the complexety of 3D rendering, while further sparked my growing intrest in 3D rending. Another nice feature was it exports into Macromedia's Flash, and will tolerate other Marcromedia software.However, the down side is only one book availabe to learn the program and the built in tutorials. Amphoriums website also contians some more walk throughs and I have had good luck there find links to others who could help.Over all great product, but lack of support may hurt long term success.","Very good for beginners.

1,Great Toy!,"My husband purchased this toy for my daughter's 1st birthday and she loves it. She can play with this toys for hours. It's perfect for her height and her age. She learned how to put the pots on the stove to make the sizzle and bubbling sounds, she laughs when she hears it. This toy is durable. My daughter has tipped it over many times to sit on it and it still has held up really well. Of course I don't recommend kids tip it over to sit on it , but you know kids they like to climb on everything.","Great Toy!.

1,best superhero movie ever,"The cast was fantastic bringing human emotion to what could have been a dumb effects-driven piece of fluff (anyone remember the last batman movie?) This movie had great pacing and detailed characterizations. the special effects were very dynamic if at times a bit cartoonish. the spirit of stan lee and steve ditko's creation of some 40 years ago remains intact with a minimum of updating to be contemporary. the bonus features are worthwhile and this is a must own for fans of the character, the genre, or general fans of action films. highest recommendation.","best superhero movie ever.

Every minute of practice needs to be fun or they'll do something else.

1,To make good even better - keep them in the freezer!,"These are very good, but in the very warm weather the filling can go soft.So I keep mine in the freezer. Try and keep them sealed to avoid moisture -all I do is fold the silver packet over - and they are really good. Thereis not enough to them to taste cold - but they are crisper. I only keepthe packet I have open in the freezer. See what you think.","To make good even better - keep them in the freezer!.

1,A doozie,"Next to Othello, Shakespeare's most haunting royal tragedy. And quite easy to follow along, if you delve closely into the language. King Lear was more complex but the theme of callous ambition still rings true today, with elements of the supernatural thrown in for good measure, such as Banquo's ghost and those sublime cackling old witches. Best enjoyed if you just mouth the words out loud, or better yet, see a production of it lived out on stage. The action is fast, and really, you can read the whole thing in probably about an hour.","A doozie. Next to Othello, Shakespeare's most haunting royal tragedy.

0,eh.,"This show is funny, but it is with all of the wrong things. It deals with sex, sex and more sex. That is not the only thing to make jokes about. I know several other struggling comedies on TV that can't make it even though they are absolutley amazing.

1,Schopenhauer in 90 Minutes by Paul Strathern,"The thinker, Schopenhauer has a series of complex writingswhich underlie academic discussion around the time of Goethe.Schopenhauer felt that the universe would be blind withoutpurpose or the concept of being. The concept of a free willbrings with it misery and suffering as practical consequences.Hope tends to be free of the egoistic side of man. Goethedebated frequently with Schopenhauer. The fact that all colorsare an amalgum of light and dark lay at the foundation ofGoethe's discussions. Schopenhauer believed that the willpermeated everything. In fact, when the will replaces knowledge-the result is obstinacy and ignorance. As an illustration,the author showed that a true impression of someone could begleaned in letter-writing. This work is good, if you are astudent of Schopenhauer ; and, you find the need to integratehis works into a unified whole for interpretive purposes.","Schopenhauer in 90 Minutes by Paul Strathern.

0,This Bicycle is Complete Garbage,"What a disappointment!!! We bought this for my 4 year old son for a Christmas present. He asked Santa for it several times and was so excited that it was a ""John Deere"" themed bike as he loves his grandpa's John Deere tractor. Thank God we tried to put it together before the holiday or else we would have had one very sad little boy on our hands on Christmas morning. The forks the hold the front tire onto the bike do not align at all, making it IMPOSSIBLE to get the front tire onto the bike. Aside from this major manufacturer defect, there also are no assembly instructions included with the bicycle. All in all, this product is very cheaply made. Now, not only do we have to buy our son a new bike someplace else, but we have to explain to him why Santa couldn't deliver the ""John Deere"" bike that he asked him for. Thanks Learning Curve.","This Bicycle is Complete Garbage. What a disappointment!!! We bought this for my 4 year old son for a Christmas present.

0,"Magnets Not Strong Enough, Slides When Towels Pulled Off","I was really excited to find this product at a good price. It would have been perfect, five stars, if the magnets were strong enough.

It is NOT a stainless steel refrigerator, which I understand have problems with all types of magnets sticking on them. My refrigerator has a very, very slight texture to it and again the magnets stuck but then slid right down the refrigerator everytime I pulled a paper towel off.So that tells me that it must work only on plain, unpainted, perfectly smooth metal, which makes it useless to me.Again, if the magnets were stronger so that it wouldn't slide down everytime I pull a paper towel off, I would have given it five stars.","Magnets Not Strong Enough, Slides When Towels Pulled Off.

0,A classic ruined,"What happened to the Paul Bunyan I remember from my childhood? This version has been dumbed down, sweetened up and turned into drivel.

1,About to be a Major Motion Picture,"This is absolutely one of my all-time favorite novels. It has it all -- the glitz, as well as the seedy underside, of Hollywood; international intrigue; drug smuggling; Mafiaso; a serial killer on the loose; blood and gutts (in the operating room and out); life, death, love, sex, and boobjobs. And it's so incredibly well written.So I'm really excited to find this novel is finally being made into a movie. On the Internet Movie Database (at imdb [.] com) page for screenwriter/producer Kathleen Bartholomew it states she is adapting the novel for the screen.","About to be a Major Motion Picture.

I think He likes us to pray so that when it does happen, we know it was Him who did it and that we thank Him, but I cannot agree that God needs man to pray else His hands are tied.","Did not agree with the premise the book is based on.

0,Shockingly Disappointing,"I'm very optimistic about an artist's work and I'm not quick to judge anybodys work as disappointing unless it's just that. Being that Mr.Ware produced and co-wrote one of the greatest albums of all time(I Want You). I was definitely eager to hear him do his own work. Although the writing is pretty good on the album, the songs just dont seem to jump out at you. There is not much to it that would makes you want to hear it again and again, and I'm a huge fan of of 70's soul. Maybe that is what Motown thought also, maybe they thought fans would rather spend their last on a sandwich. Which is maybe the reason Mr.ware didn't get the support for this album that he believed he deserved. I still honor him for his genius as a writer particularly with the work he's done with Marvin and Minnie Riperton.","Shockingly Disappointing.

Presumably Lego has some secret plastic formula that make their stuff work well, but these blocks alternate between requiring force to put together, or spontaneously disassembling themselves.

1,Good book that could have been great,"Since I'm a frequent visitor to the excellent CSS Zen Garden web site, I purchased this book hoping that it would enlighten me regarding the technical implementation of some of the more advanced CSS designs.

This is all good, but I was hoping to see at least a few of the very advanced designs completely dissected in explanation, from beginning of the source to the end. Intermediate CSS coders will undoubtedly pick up a useful technique or two. Still, it's a good book that could have been great.","Good book that could have been great.

1,Stuck in Neutral By: Terry Trueman,"Stuck in Neutral is such a great book. The main character in this book is Shawn McDainel. Unfortunately, he has cerebral palsy and has no control over any of the muscles in his body. He can't feed himself, can't swallow food or anything on his own, he has many seizers, and he is in a wheelchair. He also has no control of his bladder. Imagine not having any control of anything that your body can do. Shawn lives with his mother, sister, and brother. His dad obviously doesn't live with him but still loves him very much. He often sees shawn suffering by having seizers and he feels bad for him and doesn't think he deserves to go through this. Shawn gets the idea that his dad wants to kill him to ""end his pain."" Shawn is frightend and doesn't know what to do. His dad later goes on a talk show with a man, Earl Detraux, who killed his son to also end his pain.

0,Avoid the Frustration,"I bought a Toshiba because of its supposed quality name. Unfortunately, I was led astray. The dvd/vcr 291 hummed and buzzed loudly when I hooked it up. Then, when I tried to record a tv program, the resulting picture rolled and jumped so much that no amount of adjusting would fix it. I returned it to Best Buy and they exchanged it for a Samsung, no questions asked.Besides the terrible recording, I struggled through the remote's instructions with its multitude of buttons. I'm no idiot, but after an hour trying to figure out which buttons did what, I began blathering like one.So, avoid this piece of junk.","Avoid the Frustration.

0,"beautifully written, terribly boring...","I loved The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, and I also liked The Final Solution, which was a mystery novella by Chabon, so I was excited to read this. Of course, it's amazingly written. I give the prose five stars. But that's not enough to save it. To put it simply, the story is just terribly boring. It never gets interesting. Around page 300, I said to myself, ""Okay, it's gotta start picking up soon."" But it just didn't. It's not that I don't appreciate great prose. I do. But I don't see much point in reading beautiful words that tell a boring story when I could be reading beautiful words that tell an interesting story, like his other works or works by other authors. I'm not giving up on Chabon though. I'll probably read the next book he writes. I just hope it's more interesting than The Yiddish Policemen's Union.","beautifully written, terribly boring....

1,Wonderful suspense!,"I am really not much on suspense but Mystic River pulled me into its depths and made me want to know more. More about what happened to Dave, the child who was molested at 11 and grew up to be a scarred man. More about Sean, the cool kid who grew up to be the cop investigating a murder. More about Jimmy, part of Dave and Sean's group who grew up to be a criminal and whose daughter was the one murdered. These 3 characters will get inside you and take hold of all of your senses. You can actually see the blood on the ground and feel the Mystic River flowing by. This was my first experience with Dennis Lehane, but it will not be my last.","Wonderful suspense!.

1,Wonderful testament to life!,"Believe it or not, this book is not gloomy, dark or depressing. While it does, by necessity, often go into vivid detail about the diseases and physical suffering of a number of mothers, overall the book embraces joy and life itself; the searching and questioning and the coming to terms with life-altering ideas/emotions that all of us share at some level. I especially love the photos of the writers' mothers. They are all so bittersweet and add a poignancy to each writer's essay. I am not a gay male and my mother is still alive, but I still found this book meaningful and touching in an all too human way.","Wonderful testament to life!.

I even started to apply Frontline every three weeks rather than once a month, but that had zero effect.

She recommended Trifexis (you have to get a prescriptions because it also helps prevent heartworms), and within about an hour no more fleas.","Just stopped working.

0,A bit dissapointing.,"I bought this box set to give this series a second chance.

As a child playing the Legend of Zelda on the old NES system, it was unplesant to see our ""Legendary Green Hatted Hero"" as a semi plump, snort laughing, perverse womanizer with the tagline ""Excuse me, Princess!""This is a great buy if you're looking for some laughs and nostalgia, but if you're a hard core Zelda fan who has never seen this, and expect it to be a serious action show, you'll be in for a huge dissapointment.","A bit dissapointing..

1,Great Horror All It's Own,"To start off, the original Dawn Of The Dead could never be replaced or out done by a remake, but the remake is incredible just like the original. The best thing about it was that it wasn't a duplicate of the original, like the remake of Psycho where it was exactly the same. This film just takes the base story form the original, like the shopping mall, and then goes in it's own direction. Now the zombies run, which I still haven't made up my mind about which is better walking or running zombies. This movie had eveything a great horror movie needs, the suspense, some jump scenes, a little nudity, I especially loved the scene where an acoustic version of Down With The Sickness is played. All together this movie is really great with the effects, the gore, and an all around great story. Note be sure to watch to the end of the credits to learn the fate of the group.","Great Horror All It's Own.

It is so tiny, it fits in my rolling laptop case along with my laptop and many extra cables, and it weighs very little. I love that it is SO SIMPLE to set up and use.

I use the process both for watercolor sketches and for art quilt designs. No more trips to kinkos for enlarging.The only drawback I have noticed is that the room needs to be pretty dark in order to get a clear image.

1,Where is Flagpole Sitta?,"I wanted to know what was on this cd, and now that I know, I am upset. Harvey Danger is all over the movie -- in the previews, and in the movie itself. Why wasn't it put on the CD? In my opinion, however, the other songs on this CD are good. That is why it deserves 4 stars.","Where is Flagpole Sitta?.

0,I returned mine today.,"I don't know if it's common with this model or if I just got a bad one. In either case, I returned mine today. On several different movies, the picture and sound would just start to break up. I had it for a week or two. At first, I thought it was the movie - but it continued to happen too many times. I also have an older Panasonic A210 which doesn't have this problem (on the same movies). I'll most likely buy a different one from Amazon.com. They've always offered great service and were very helpful in providing me information to return this item. They even sent the UPS label out to me, pre-paid for the return.","I returned mine today..

1,Gets the Job Done,"Criticism of this book is tempered by keeping one important fact in mind; I found all that I needed to begin developing and customizing WorldSoftware applications without the need for formal J.D. Edwards education. So, the author did a thorough job while sometimes wasting words on overblown praise for the product, overemphasizing the value of the report writers, and repeating his confusing practice of picking topics up in the middle, only to provide the necessary information later. I don't have a similar book to compare it to but I must admit that this one is all that I have needed thus far.","Gets the Job Done.

0,"Great Imagery, Very Lacking Stories","While the images used in this book are fantastic, very well drawn and the color is exquisite, that's where the book ends.The fables themselves are short-winded versions, very poorly written in my opinion. I bought the book to read to my five year old, who is definitely able to comprehend intricate stories and is extremely well-spoken for his age, but the stories offered nothing for either of us... they had no lead ins , often went straight to the point (most of the stories are only one or two short paragraphs), and only one or two even mentioned the moral of the story (which is often lost due to large parts of the fables being cut out).I ended up just telling him the versions of the stories I remembered while he looked at the pictures. Definitely not a good choice.","Great Imagery, Very Lacking Stories.

1,Performs as advertised,"Very easy out-of-the-box functionality. I've owned for a few weeks and it seems to be working well. I have a 750 sq. ft. basement fully finished but without A/C ventilation. I'd say the unit does not necessarily draw in enough moisture to cover the entire area, but it definitely makes a difference. Make sure the top air vent door is always open unless the unit will overheat. Don't bother using the internal bucket because it fills up in less than a day. The continuous drainage funtion is great, but opening is slightly too big for a 1/2"" inner diameter hose. I recommend buying the 1/2"" and stretching the opening to ensure a tight fit. The unit is very, very quiet which is fantastic.","Performs as advertised. Very easy out-of-the-box functionality. I've owned for a few weeks and it seems to be working well.

Hardwire connections to a Dell desktop and a Mac G5.It's been hit pretty heavy by everyone for the entire day and I haven't encountered the heat issue that some have mentioned.This replaces a previous D-Link router (which I'll keep just in case for a backup).

The 5000xt provides a jaw dropping 250 GB of external drive storage at 5400 rpm. It connects to your PC using either USB (1.1 or 2.0) or FireWire. What makes this drive more than just a behemoth of storage is its capacity for push-button back-ups. You push a button on the drive unit and it backs up any changes you have made since your last backup. For me, this seems very convenient.

0,Where's the action?,"This book started well with Gunny Bass returning to the 34th FIST but it trails off from there. There was very little combat and when there was, it was very sporadic.The dialogue and the innards of the Marine relationships was outstanding as always, but I felt that the perspectives were too diluted. The point of view seemed to come from every single fire team leader, squad leader, platoon leader. It made the whole story, well boring.I would have given it 3 stars but I've also compared it with the other books in the series and that is why I've dropped it down to 2 stars.I will continue to read this book because I feel a major conflict brewing between the 34th FIST and the SKINKS.","Where's the action?.

0,Wish I'd bought something else,"After much research I bought this bedrail for our 2 1/2-year-old. I was very disappointed. I purchased this model because it seemed to be the only one that didn't have bulky rails under the mattress that would ruin the mattress and box springs. The product is very misleading in that respect. It has even bulkier rails than other models that fit 4-5 inches under the mattress (and they have sharp points that will tear holes in the box springs in no time), then the strap, then these worthless L-shaped bars on the other side that always turn sideways.

I was very disappointed. I purchased this model because it seemed to be the only one that didn't have bulky rails under the mattress that would ruin the mattress and box springs. The product is very misleading in that respect. It has even bulkier rails than other models that fit 4-5 inches under the mattress (and they have sharp points that will tear holes in the box springs in no time), then the strap, then these worthless L-shaped bars on the other side that always turn sideways.

1,"A primer book, not for advanced learning","I used this book to getting started with learning C programming. It's very good for the reasons: 1) the topics and illustrations are well organized; 2) it's very clear and unambiguous; 3) many complete examples and exercises. I really appreciate the last because the only way for someone to master a programming language is to read more and write more.However, merely reading this book can not make you an advanced C programmer. It just gives you very brief introductions on more advanced topics in Chapter 14, i.e. using command-line arguments, working with multiple source files et al. Moreover, as a book for C, I think this book includes too much information for C++, i.e. this book uses 40% total pages for C++.To conclusion. This is a good book for novices, but not for someone who needs advanced skills.

1,What a return to Form,"This CD is such a comfort after the last two. I was afraid that Tori was on a downward slope after the horribly inconsistant ""To Venus And Back"", and the less than stellar cover album ""Strange Little Girls."" This album is probably my second favorite album by her behind ""Little Earthquakes"" and ""From The Choirgirl Hotel"" which are tied for my number one spot. However, in many ways ""Scarlet's Walk"" is a better album than both of those. I say this because this is the first one of her albums that I can honestly say I love every song. For me, Tori's biggest weakness has always been her inconsistency. There were always a few tracks on all of her albums that either screamed b-side, sounded as though they didn't belong, or were simply bad songs. I can honestly say that isn't the case with ""Scarlet's Walk.""","What a return to Form. This CD is such a comfort after the last two.

1,Great popper,"I was wary of buying one of these machines, based on what I'd heard about popcorn poppers. This one really DOES work well! There are *very* few unpopped kernels, though they do sometimes get mixed in with the popped ones. I use a large bowl with it, but even so, I do get some spillage. It's also loud. I can live with all that.. My only real complaint is that the popcorn isn't really crisp, as it is with a traditional oil popper. Maybe that's just how it is with hot air poppers? I'm using Orville Redenbaucher kernels, by the way. I'm not sure that makes a difference. I still eat tons of it, knowing it's healthy and filling!

1,very comfortable,"I started weearing these shoes when I had bad trouble with my feet. I only did well with shoes that had great arch support. These shoes had the best arch support of any that I tried and I wore them almost exclusively though I had 30 pairs of shoes in my closet. I no longer have these problems, but still wear them most of the time for their incredible comfort. Recently I bought a new pair that said Sanita on one part and Dansko on the other. I can no longer remember whether the inside of the shoe said Sanita or whether it was the sole. Anyway, the sole developed big crackes in it that went all the way through the sole, in spite of the fact that I hardly ever wore them. I took them to a shoe repair guy who said they could not be fixed, and that there was something wrong with the mixture of materials in the sole. I called Dansko, but they said there was nothing they could do because it was a Sanita problem.","very comfortable. I started weearing these shoes when I had bad trouble with my feet.

0,"Nice graphics, few choices","The graphics are great but the limited track and repetitive route lead to a quick loss in interest. The great graphics and driving ""feeling"" are soon not enough to hold your interest. Also, there is no option to steer with either the thumb controller or the arrow pad, you are forced to the thumb controller which I do not prefer.","Nice graphics, few choices.

1,XTC must have,"First let me say that if you're looking for something similar to their older music forget it. They'll never write stuff like that again because their older and don't have enough youth angst (or whatever). Second, this album makes up for Nonsuch.

1,Try Sunflower Seeds,"If you hate the mess of the old wooden Victor style traps, you'll love this new design. No more trying to squeeze cheese or peanut butter onto that little cylinder and no need to touch the mouse or clean its remains off the trap. Just fill the little cup up with sunflower seeds and scatter a few around the trap to attract attention. The lever on the top allows you to set the trap with no risk of catching a finger and no misfires. It also lets you drop the dead mouse without getting close to it. My new trap caught the mouse that had been ignoring my old traps in less than three hours. I'm ordering more.","Try Sunflower Seeds.

0,"Stephen, how could you?!?","I picked this up at the library this afternoon solely because of Stephen King's high praise, and now I'm wondering if I should bother with the other two books I also checked out at his recommendation. The book is well and often wittily written (NOT well-constructed, mind you), and I afford it two stars for that, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. The protagonist is so poorly fleshed-out that I never even bothered to form a picture of him in my head (and certainly don't care what he may be up to in her next novel), and the remaining characters are either equally boring or so over-the-top as to be unbelievable. The most annoying, unsatisfying, unforgivable thing however is the author's lazy use of the deux ex machina to ""tie up"" one of the story lines. This felt like three short stories - only one of them at all compelling - forced together to make up a ""novel."" Really, really disappointing.","Stephen, how could you?!?.

0,Unrated,"It is a questionable practice for a producer to make all his protagonists completely unsympathetic. Characters ranged from driven by lust and gluttony to selfishly using others to gain quick wealth (greed and vanity). Even though the plot allows the possibility of a character arc and redemption, the main protagonist barely takes advantage of it. I initially preferred to give this zero stars, but on further consideration I think one star is justified: this movie proves to me that Sacha Baron Cohen cannot act, so I saved myself from seeing Borat. On the other hand, I give this three stars for Boring and five stars for Stupid, giving it an overall rating of four stars on my BS scale.","Unrated.

0,Tools not to be taken seriously,"These tools are meant to be given to someone as a joke I think, not for anyone to do anything meaningful around a home. They are made of flimsy plastic and weak metal.

The drill is a complete joke since it has zero power to even assemble pre-drilled holes for screws -- again, the screw lasted longer than the drill bit. VERY, VERY disappointed in this. I'm sure someone else out there has pink tools for women that are not a complete flop.

1,The Verve Pipe Rocks!,"The Verve Pipe has released its' best album to date! Every song on this album is amazing. There is not a mediocre song on the album and I found it hard not to sing along with every song. The new self-titled CD has been the only thing I've listened to for the past week and I don't intend to stop anytime soon. The Verve Pipe has found a way to effectively mix slow songs, such as 'Kiss Me Idle' and 'Half a Mind' with rockin' songs such as 'Hero' and 'Generations.' 'Television' is awesome and anyone hearing the chorus would be unable to resist screaming it aloud with Brian Vanderark. Pick this album up! It will definitely be one of the best albums of all time for me.","The Verve Pipe Rocks!. The Verve Pipe has released its' best album to date! Every song on this album is amazing.

Also many of the new things added involve your body guards and are thus completely useless because your body guards die instantly on any difficulty setting and wont get stronger unless they survive an entire level. Also in response to the many complaints about super archers, Koei has wisely responded by making enemy archers faster, more acurate and more damaging! Party on fanboys!","Save your money.

1,The Truth is Like a Stone,"Those on the Religious Right will hate this book, of course, whether they call themselves Christians or Muslims or Jews. After all, it exposes their religious bigotry and hypocrisy. It exposes the bloodthirsty ""end times-last days"" nonsense. It delivers the promised judgment that will, in due time, bring low the proud and militant religious zealots, and enable the humble, faithful and meek to inherit the earth, just as Jesus promised.So don't pay any mind to the critics who hate the truth and call it a lie, because while they may have God on their lips, they have hate in their hearts. As Jesus warned, beware of false prophets and hypocrites, because while they claim to do many wonderful works in the name of the Lord, they know Him not. And remember, as Daniel foresaw, the ""stone"" of truth will shatter the image of the pretender to the throne, and the stone shall become as a great mountain that fills the earth. Truth will prevail, and set us free...thank God.","The Truth is Like a Stone. Those on the Religious Right will hate this book, of course, whether they call themselves Christians or Muslims or Jews.

1,Requiem & La Chasse,"For the most part, Harnoncourt keeps his quirkiness under control and accordingly delivers a stunning performance. Such are his insights, even those who suffer from K 626 Fatigue will quake as if hearing this masterpiece for the first time. The sound-engineers have excelled themselves. That being said, I would have bet good money that the Hostias was going to be a trainwreck before I hit the play-button and so it proved to be. Call me an antiquated Romantic if you want, but this movement (and the text itself) clamours for a meditative approach, not an attempt to break the land speed record. So all in all, this is a stellar performance with one big fat sunspot.","Requiem & La Chasse.

I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod, but it COULD be shot from the hip. He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!","Old School Action Movie.

0,Defective - two of these Xtreme quit working,"I tried... twice. But both of these ""toy toothbrushes"" quit working. In the past I had a great experience with an older Sonicare toothbrush and was hoping for similar quality with this simpler, cheaper and replaceable battery powered device. No such luck. After a couple weeks it just stopped. Phillips was kind enough to replace it but the replacement also failed after a couple weeks. My advise is to avoid the Xtreme and buy the higher price device (or stick to the simple manual toothbrush).","Defective - two of these Xtreme quit working. I tried... twice.

0,Doesn't work with iphone4,"I bought a new iphone4 and needed a new bluetooth headset as my older Motorola, which worked perfectly with my Nokia phone, did not work at all with my new one. I looked at the reviews and bought the Plantronics headset that had all the latest features, but was about half the price of the very newest model. Needless to say, it was a complete waste of money. I spent over 6 hours with Apple tech support going through all configurations of their software, firmware, and even paying $30 for a hardware replacement just to isolate that it was this headset that was incompatible. It's too late to return this one, the money I spent getting an iphone replacement, and the money I will have to spend to get a high end bluetooth headset that will work (about $160) start to add up. Bottom line: don't waste your money.","Doesn't work with iphone4.

0,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I was excited to play this game with the kids. Like the other reviews say, it is a good idea poorly executed.

1,Great deal for casual juicers,"The product came packaged as if it was brand-new and there wasn't a scratch on it. If it hadn't been listed as reconditioned then I wouldn't have known it. I don't use mine every day so this is perfect for me and the right price but you do have to cut up larger fruit and vegtables because the opening isn't very big. So for someone who uses it everyday that would be an inconvience. It is easy to clean as long as you do it right away but I would recommend getting a bigger brush, the one that it comes with it is too small for cleaning the whole machine.","Great deal for casual juicers.

1,Solid Rear Support,"This is a good partner for my Caldwell Rock Jr. rifle rest. It provides snug support for the butt of the rifle and can be squeezed for fine adjustment to the rear of the rifle when shooting. It's also heavey enought to not slide around much when shooting. If you get this, look at the Rock or Rock jr. for the front end as well. They work well together.","Solid Rear Support. This is a good partner for my Caldwell Rock Jr. rifle rest.

1,Another Great Gossip Girl,"Cecily Von Ziegesar really keeps things interesting in her seventh Gossip Girl book. In this book, Senior Spa Weekend is coming. Things with Blair and Nate aren't good, when Nate steals his parents yacht to bring with stoner friends on vacation. Blair gets mad because Nate was supposed to meet her at the Plaza Hotel. Dan leaves the Raves band after he pukes all over at a concert, and Jenny joins as the lead singer, that is until things fall apart with her life. Next year she won't be back at Constance Billard, unless she repeats ninth grade. Blair moves in with Vanessa and gives her apartment a makeover and hooks Vanessa up with Aaron. At the Senior Spa Weekend, Blair finds out that she has made it into Yale, and also that Nate is cheating on her with Lexique and she finds Serena making out with him. Interesting gossipy book.

0,A piece of crap.,We installed new six years ago. After 3 years the faucet stuck in open and we had to spend nearly $400 for a new faucet plus the plumber. Now the hot water tank is leaking and we had to buy a new tank for over $200 and pay a plumber to install. So count on replacing the initial cost time and time again. The company obviously has not got good designs and just wants to sell replacements that cannot be repaired.,A piece of crap.. We installed new six years ago.

1,Good Phone,"I recently got this one from t-Mobile(returning the Blackberry Pearl) and i am more than happy. Very sleak and easy to use. Motorola has indeed taken care of so many problems with the older RAZR phones. Now the battery lasts longer, phone charges faster, has a 1.3 MP camera(works okay) and a Micro SD card slot for all the music you want.The bluetooth works like a charm( i am using a Plantronics 510 headset). Its missing some of the features that my Nokia 6600 has, but i am okay with without them.I would give it 5* but the user interface lets me down. For instance, to turn on Bluetooth, i have to navigate thru quite a lot.Overall a good phone with decent features.","Good Phone.

1,A musical romp,"A musical based on the Broadway show which in turn was based on the original film which was awesome. Although derivitive it is good in its own right, especially with some of the musical numbers in it. The film never quite makes the same level of comedy that the original movie does though, mostly because this version has compressed and combined many of the characters (""LSD"" does not appear at all in this version, for example) but it partially makes up for it with some scenes, dialogue and numbers which would never have made it in the original film. Well worth watching.","A musical romp. A musical based on the Broadway show which in turn was based on the original film which was awesome.

Not nearly enough attention is paid nowadays to the classic ballparks of the 20s and 30s other than the storied Ynakee Stadium and through this book we are introduced to not only the stadiums which at the time were cutting edge but to the players and stories of what occured within their fences.

0,Look great but feel bad,"These shoes certainly are beautiful, but they aren't very comfortable, at least not for me. When I first tried them on, even though the egg crate foot bed was cushy but my foot just felt smothered and like it couldn't breath. The shoes felt a bit too crowded, and yet the heel was sliding off every time I took a step. I hoped it would go away but it just got worse. By the end of the day my feet were sweating (and thats very unusual for me) the outer sides of my feet both hurt significantly, enough that I knew I would have to return them. I had ordered an 8.5 wide size because I had a sneaking suspicion that they would feel narrower than most shoes, from all the cushioning. And I do have feet that are slightly wider than most. (this was the first pair of Wide shoes I've ever ordered - I wear normal shoes all the time without any discomfort) I bought the open backed soft walk shoes instead and they are much more comfortable no pain at all.","Look great but feel bad.

0,An awful snob in Venice,"After a week in Venice I wanted to live there forever. Picking up this book to read on the plane home, I hoped to see the city through other eyes and put my own dream into perspective. It starts well: the reader empathises with the Venetian disease Weinbereg catches. Half way through this book turns into a nasty diatribe against some Venetians and many expatriates. The author seems to think her closing section on a car-crash in Italy and its aftermath will make up for her bile. It doesn't, it won't.If I ever do live in Venice I fervently hope never to encounter this snobbish, garrulous and self-centered New Yorker. The book is not only a waste of money, but an offense to Venice and to readers. How on earth did this get published?","An awful snob in Venice. After a week in Venice I wanted to live there forever.

0,Less than expected,The remote is horrible as you have to point it directly at the DVD player and press the buttons multiple times to get it to work. The remote also lacks a open/close button which I thought was fairly standard.The DVD player itself is less than adequate. I can think of at least 3-4 times since I bought it that it has frozen and not played a DVD. I am not talking burned or damaged DVD's...I put them in my other DVD player and my X-box and they work just fine. What is equally annoying is the fact that it freezes the controls on the dvd player so I have to reach around my entertainment center to unplug it each time it decides to be tempormental. I will never buy a Philips again.,Less than expected. The remote is horrible as you have to point it directly at the DVD player and press the buttons multiple times to get it to work.

0,Can only be used with full zoom,"The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight.","Can only be used with full zoom.

0,terrible idea,"Great, so Raiders is finally released on DVD, but forcibly packaged with its inferior brothers Temple and Crusade. Fantastic.It's a shame, because I was really looking forward to purchasing Raiders, one of my all time favorites. Sadly I'm not nearly stupid enough to pay $... and patronize a set of DVDs when the whole idea makes me sick. First it was Back to the Future (I only wanted the first one then, too) and now this.What worries me is that the James Bond DVD sets 2 and 3 are coming out soon, and I don't think they're going to get broken up, either -- which is a shame because I already own about half from each set. When did DVD producers get this completely rotten idea? And what jerk told them it was good?","terrible idea.

0,A departure,"In their classic ""Playdough,"" The Aquabats pay tribute to Devo. The Devo influence becomes very obvious on their 3rd CD, which is also their weakest effort. Most of their trademark ska is missing from this album, replaced by a very Devo-esque new wave pop feel. It can be fun, but it just doesn't compare to the early stuff. In fact, some of the songs will have you reaching for the ""skip"" button, a first for an Aquabats CD. The songs are still wacky and have that Aquabats humor to them, but they're also slower and less melodic and fun. Luckily, for every weak song on the album, there's a good one to balance it out. Some of the best include the irresistibly fun ""Man With Glooey Hands"" and ""Lovers Of Loving Love,"" which might just be the greatest love song ever written. Unfortunately, those songs will be among the only ones played on this album. The rest may simply be skipped and forgotten. Still a great band though.","A departure.

0,LP needs to redesign their bags' closures,"This is an OK bag, but like many of Lowepro's bags/packs, the zippers are awkward and stiff to use. Bought it for a new Lumix LX-5, which fits very well. But the main compartment sits back toward the belt clip (which is nicely designed), so you have to struggle a bit to unzip and extract the camera. I may return it and go with a case logic or some case that's easier to get in and out of. This has plenty of padding, so much that it adds a lot of bulk. I like protecting my camera, but this is a compact point and shoot, so making it bulky defeats the purpose. Too many of LPs products seem to be better for storage of the camera equipment rather than using it.","LP needs to redesign their bags' closures.

1,Tintin!,"Having read volume 2 of this collection I can honestly say that Herge took some time to find his feet with the series. The first two Tintin books, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo, were so racially and culturally insensitive that they have rarely been reprinted and aren't even included in this collection. The first story in this volume, Tintin in America, isn't quite that bad, but it is still on the tail of the same trend. It's a boring, repetitive story that's racially insensitive. The other two stories, however, mark the beginning of a turning point in the series. Cigars of the Pharaoh and The Blue Lotus are two connected stories that are deep, complex, and entertaining beyond belief. The stories in volume 2 just get better. So if you buy this and are knee-deep into Tintin in America and aren't feeling it, know that it's not representative of the series as a whole, and maybe consider just skipping to Cigars of the Pharaoh.","Tintin!.

The features are nice, but something sticks when I lift the reciever, so it will keep ringing even though the reciever is up. In addition, I think something is wrong with the cord, because if you move slightly during conversations, it will cut out. Voice quality is kind of scratchy, too. Neat features, but if you want neat features to play with on your phone, get a cellphone and play with the endless pleathora of ring tones.","Works great, except it will randomly disconect during calls.

The solos, (of which I have memorized every note) are virtuoso improvisations. The rest of the album is great too. But La Nevada stands alone.","A Masterpiece.

1,"A quick-moving, provocative page-turner.","I didn't necessarily personally identify with the father-son relationship in this novel, but that didn't detract from how great a story I think it is.Wallace writes with wit and intelligence that is very convincing. The novel is truly ""a novel of mythical proportions"" because it ranks alongside many male American myths such as Horatio Alger books, Catcher in the Rye, Huck Finn, and Peace Like a River in my opinion. There is much to think about in these pages and the characters are lovable as well as the story itself. Finally, for those who don't have a lot of time for reading, this book is perfect. I read it in a day, mostly on the airplane. It's short, but very effective, encompassing many dear ideals of America. I recommend this book to everyone.","A quick-moving, provocative page-turner..

When a woman ( Claire Bloom ) is confronted with a little forgery she did - - signing her husband's signature, she expects that he will stand by her. Matter over. But, her husband and their home take on a terrible twist. Dynamic story twists and excellent performances. Based on a play by Henrik Ibsen.","Sir Tony was terrific in this!.

0,Not all that,"A reviewer on the paperback (Booklist, in a starred review) compared this to the best of Patricia Cornwell. No comparison. Cornwell is graphic, and her habit of having criminals stalk her characters instead of the other way around can be wearing, but her scientific jargon (while keeping the jist available to the reader) is of a much higher quality than this. The obvious leads to a further plot development in this book (dropped in casual conversation, and ignored at the time by the characters involved) are unlikely. Dialogue is stilted. Good scientific skills and their basis are articulated, and interesting basic forensic skills, both criminal and anthropological, are introduced. It's a good start.","Not all that.

It's no surprise that Water's life is funnier, and more bizare then any of his films can ever hope to be. We learn about Baltimore life, his childhood, Divine, Edith Masey, Pink Flamingos,Desperate Living,and more. THIS needs to be his next film project! The only thing sad about this book is that it feels dated at certain parts (especially when it refers to Divine in the present tense, since this was written before he died...and before Cookie Muller died...and Edith Masey). But it remains a fascinating read that really encourages people to feel grateful for living in Baltimore(or makes you wish you lived there).","Delightful, distasteful, nauseating and fun!.

0,Lacking in longevity,"I bought these boots in the middle of December, and found them to be very well suited to what I needed them for (working as a cart attendant in western Michigan). Unfortunately, over the last month and a half, they have developed a number of problems of varying severity have ensued (listed in chronological order):1) The insoles that were included in the boot wore out within a week of their arrival. Not a big deal, but it did make the boots rather uncomfortable until I could replace them.2) One of the eyelets yanked out of the leather. This didn't impede my ability to wear them any.3) One of the laces broke, which was of course easily replaced.4) Holes began to develop in the sole. It is at the point now where they need to replaced soon.Now, I walk pigeon toed and I am particularly hard on shoes, but 1.5 months seems to be a very short life span. I've gotten a longer lifetime out of my cheap wal-mart tennis shoes.","Lacking in longevity.

1,Thorough but also entertaining and stimulating,"Really a remarkable book in that it covers so much goings-on, countries, kingdoms, people, etc but does so in an enjoyable way. Very thorough and explicit in details and a great reference book- and also is a joy to read. Sometimes, I admit, the chapters can jump from subject to subject but I think this is more due to the scope of the work and not the author's fault. It covers so much information that I couldn't imagine trying to organize such a book. Also, satisifying, the work is honest and not as 'politically correct' as most modern books written about the colonialism in Africa. It tells the good, the bad, and the ugly of both the European elements and native elements in the tragic tale. It also fascinatingly details the politics in Europe and American with regard to the 'scramble'. Highly recommended.","Thorough but also entertaining and stimulating.

0,Excess Sound? Is this right?,"When I got the camera, I immediately noticed the small size. That along with the CCD were pluses, but as soon as I turned on the camera for recording, that's when the problems started. First of all, please, somebody tell me if this is correct or if I should return it for an exchange (mine may be faulty):The winding noise from the DV tape is captured onto all films recorded. This means that there is a constant train like noise captured onto all of the videos I record from this camcorder. I'm thinking that the manufacturer's can't be that stupid to make such a faulty mistake, so I'm gonna try to exchange this for another one. Is there any hope in doing this, or does all JVC GR-D230's have this problem?I also didn't like the need to install their proprietary software.Please, people who have this camera, tell me if this is a common mistake that you have to live with, or is this just a faulty item they shipped.

1,Great new style,"I picked this album up yesterday and its the only cd ive listened to since. Doesnt sound like a big deal but I ALWAYS have music on. I think Ive listened to it 5 times through now. I found the Ltd version (CD and DVD) for $9.99 and am I ever pleased with the money spent.I believe this album will only be enjoyed by a hardcore Incubus fan. Its not quite like anything theyve done before, which is why I like Incubus. They can switch up their styles every album and still make it sound amazing. Only a few other bands have been able to do that (Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Beatles for example).None of the songs 'jump' out at me but it is a great album to put in the background while doing homework or driving. Parts of it are very chill while some of it just makes you want to jump up and nod your head. I doubt any new Incubus fans will like this album. For you guys, I suggest checking out Make Yourself. But for an Incubus fan, this is a must get album.","Great new style. I picked this album up yesterday and its the only cd ive listened to since.

1,Hard-boiled noir from one of the masters,"I am a long-time fan of Ed McBain's. His 87th Precinct novels are superb, but it is easy to forget the great quality of his standalones. This hard-boiled novel from early in his career has trademark McBain touches: brisk efficient plotting, witty terse dialogue, and fluid nuanced prose. My only criticism is that it falls a little too perfectly into the noir framework: down and out private eye suspected in a murder who falls for the beautiful femme fatale. However, it is all done with the great McBain professionalism and polish, so accomplished for so early in his long career. It makes me miss him even more. If you have enjoyed any or all of the Hard Case Crime line, then this is one more for you to savor.","Hard-boiled noir from one of the masters. I am a long-time fan of Ed McBain's.

Bahreen while pretending to be an officer was deplorable--Not to mention jumping into bed with the 'poor victim' almost immediately. So, faced with the dilemma of whom to root for--I found myself feeling guilty for supporting Col. Bahreen.","Kathy is a creep; Lester too.

0,"Flimsy, Bad Wood","Overall a poor piece of furniture.The exposed wood is as it appears: very nice. Our cherry finish matched the cherry finish of our crib (a Da Vinci product as well, and one I'm very pleased with).However, buyer beware. This piece of furniture contains lots of particle board and cheap pine. So not only will you have a difficult time putting it together, you might not get it put together at all. The pieces of wood we received for the drawers are terrible--black spots and cracks abounded. And only two cam bolts hold in the front of the drawers, hardly enough support for these pieces. Because the holes were poorly drilled and the cam locks were bad, I couldn't get two of the three drawers properly assembled. I had to use wood glue just to attach the front. I shouldn't have to do that for $250+.","Flimsy, Bad Wood. Overall a poor piece of furniture.The exposed wood is as it appears: very nice.

1,The Real Thing,"There are two types of get rich books: those written by professional speakers who make a living telling others how to be successful, but whose only achievements are writing books and giving talks on how to get rich; and those written by people who actually ARE rich and have become self-made multi-millionaires in REAL businesses, not speaking and writing books. Masterson is firmly in the second category. I have been fortunate enough to be involved with him in several of his businesses, and he has a pure midas touch for making successful businesses, which is teachable and transferable -- and which you will learn by reading his book.

0,On Reprinted editions,"I can't imagine many people buying this book in the first place, but I purchased it to help with a project I'm working on. I was quite excited to see that there was a new edition of Thomas Carew's poems on the market. There's a very well done collection of cavalier verse that was recently put out. It's a Norton Critical Edition entitled Ben Jonson and the Cavalier Poets, released in 1974 that has a great selection. This book, however, is merely a reprint of an edition printed in 1899. Nowhere in the Amazon description of the book does it mention this, which I find downright scandalous. Scholars take their books seriously, and if the edition in question is a reprint, especially a reprint of a 100 year old book that is most certianly outdated, it should be noted somewhere on the page. I am severly disappointed. I doubt anyone at Amazon will come across this review, but I hope if they do that they address this, because it is a serious issue that could be easily remedied.","On Reprinted editions.

0,0 STARS: HORRIBLE!!!,"""Witchhouse"" is an artificial low-budget supposedly horror-comedy hybrid (plenty of unintentional comedy but zero horror) which is truly lame and totally ridiculous. In the mold of ""Night Of The Demons"", ""Witchhouse"" is about a strange girl, Elizabeth, who decides to have a party with some of her carefully selected friends at an old house named Witchhouse. Elizabeth's ancestors were Satanists and she uses a little witchcraft to conjure up one of her beloved relatives. Plagued by bad make-up, pathetic special effects, horrible acting, a poorly executed plot, and a lifeless and pathetic script, I can say without reservation that ""Withchouse"" is a total zero and a complete utter joke. Maybe a good one for the brain-dead juvenile delinquent in your home, but that's about it.","0 STARS: HORRIBLE!!!.

1,Lasts forever,This toy lasts forever. VERY DURABLE. I've had one for over 5 years. Both of my children played with it. It got the most use when they were about 6 months old. Good toy for when they learn to sit by themselves. My babies had a great time banging out some tunes. They did tend to play with it less when they got older. It is definately worth the price.,Lasts forever. This toy lasts forever. VERY DURABLE. I've had one for over 5 years. Both of my children played with it.

0,What a strange movie,"Two great actors... what went wrong?Except for the part when their pills are all mixed up and they have some very funny side-effects, the movie is just plain boring.Nothing is really defined... so you just don't feel it. You don't get to really care about the relationship between the guys, the feelings Dan has for this woman he met, the feelings he has about his kids... everything is just kind of superficial and every separate story has no depth to it.Disappointing.

1,Great book for kids learning about earthquakes and volcanoes,"I am a librarian and I love giving kids this book to use for their experiments. The experiments explain volcanoes and earthquakes in a way that is easy for them to understand. As in all experiment books, some experiment need some adult help while others require household items. The only difficulty I had with this book was the listing of the objects needed to make the experiment. They are listed awkwardly and you need to read the list carefully. (if this kink was worked out, I would have given the book 5 stars! )","Great book for kids learning about earthquakes and volcanoes.

0,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by my first visit to the Pennyfoot. This is 12th in the series and the author must be ready to ""get rid"" of the characters and it shows.

1,lightweight yet solid,"I love this little radio! After lugging around another brand ""pocket size"" radio, this one is light as a feather! I'm still not exactly sure how to program the thing (as other reviewers stated, the little owners manual leaves something to be desired, but it is a great little unit) It has a little button where you ""lock"" in what you are listening to so that it doesn't inadvertently skip to another station. Yet, you can still adjust the volume even though the station is locked in! Good feature. I researched these little pocket size radios because I want to listen to music, talk radio and tv shows while walking my dog. This is just what I was looking for. Seems like a solid little unit. I bought this one over the DT 200 because this has an auto=turn=off feature after 90 minutes, (the other unit, DT 200 shut off after 60 minutes. Too soon for me. Plus, I think I read that you can disable this feature in the DT 210 but not the DT 200... Go for this little unit. You'll be happy.","lightweight yet solid. I love this little radio!

1,I used this book a lot...,"My husband and I recently built a new old house...We were shooting for an 1830 half cape that looked as though it had been remodeled in 1860. We started with some good plans, and then went to work on the 'little stuff'. I found myself flagging page after page to show our contractor. The success of a reproduction is in the tiny details. Add them all up and you get a new house that looks old. (this window trim, this bathroom sink, this eave trim, this mantle, etc.) This book was one of our two favorite sources of ideas. The chapters were broken up into various house styles. Not all of them were applicable to us, but there were plenty that were.","I used this book a lot....

0,Needs a warning sticker for difficult issues,"I enjoyed Anna Maxted's previous novels and bought this one in hopes that it would follow in that vein. I read through the first chapter or so at the book store and thought it would be a wonderful book. However, my view abruptly changed when the main character was raped. From the perspective of a rape survivor this book was horrid. The incident came about with no warning and severely triggered me. I would have appreciated a slight warning (calling Stuart a ""rapist"" or a ""criminal"" on the book description instead of a ""cad"" would have sufficed), so that way I could have either prepared myself for what was coming or avoided the book altogether. I urge anyone who recommends this book to a friend to remember that what is light-hearted and strong to you, may not be considered as such to someone who has survived a rape (more likely it will be considred being forced to relive a traumatic event).","Needs a warning sticker for difficult issues.

1,This book is thorough but poorly written.,"It is ironic that an account of the Steely Dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable. Becker and Fagen, two contemporary literary masters by most standards, would find it strangely fitting, I suppose. Sweet's saving grace is his penchant for detail. His tome has the stories for which every avid Dan fan hungers. Recording sessions, writing sessions, band reformulations, personal melodramas, etc. These elements make it enjoyable reading, especially when accompanied by revisitations to the legendary recordings. Listening to the CD's while making one's chronological journey through this book, is distictly thrilling, as well as eye(ear)-opening. The lack of an index and of footnotes limits this volume's usefulness as a reference source however. It would be nice to see a similar effort made by a writer who posesses a similar creative energy, quirkiness and skill to that of Becker and Fagen themselves.","This book is thorough but poorly written..

The plot was just too out there to follow, the characters are poorly defined (i.e., the all ""sound"" the same so it's hard to determine who is speaking), and the drug use didn't seem to have any purpose at all. Additionally, the book just didn't seem to flow well when read. Too many thoughts left out perhaps."
1,Entertaining and thought-provoking medieval story,"A chance exploration of a streetside shrine in Rome leads journalist Stanford to pursue the story of a female pope. Stanford makes an intriguing case for the historical truth of what has long been seen as cautionary tale emphasizing the corruptibility of women. I'm not convinced by his arguments for a true historical Pope Joan, but he's presented a lot of research and historical fact in an amusingly painless read. Imagine Peter Mayle leaving Provence to turn historical detective and you've got a feel for this book!","Entertaining and thought-provoking medieval story.

1,Best personal development book ever!,"Although this book has been around since the 30's, it is still head and shoulders above the others.The title can be misleading. You do need to think and by reprogamming your mind with these time tested and proven techniques, you will become rich.The most beneficial part of the book to me was the exercise of holding a mental picture of myself for 30 minutes per day along with affirmations.All I can say, is that it works, it really works.","Best personal development book ever!.

1,Good quality and durable,"Great sounding in ear speakers! Very marginal distortion at high volume and the bass is deep (when properly in your ear). Only issue is that they tend to fall out when moving around, or if you use the ear holders you can still lose that tight fit. Not recommended for working out with these on. Also take quite a bit of 'burn in' for them to sound top notch. I guess about 3 days of everyday listening.","Good quality and durable. Great sounding in ear speakers!

0,The beginning of the end,"This is probably the most worthless album REM ever put out. The songs are badly written, mostly constructed around punk and grunge cliches. Most of the songs have no real melody, and the ones that do have melodies sound exactly like previous REM songs. REM, in spite of their protests to the contrary, were never a punk band, and this album proves it. This was the beginning of a long downturn for REM from which they have not yet recovered; in this reviewer's opinion, they should have broken up after ""Automatic For The People.""","The beginning of the end.

1,The real launchpad for Mccarthy's subsequent work,"This, much more so than the Orchard Keeper, feels like McCarthy's first full work. The narrative focus is much tighter, even if the paths that Culla and Rinthy take are every bit as shiftless and as doomed. But by the end of the book, Mccarthy has stepped well beyond the typical southern Gothic territory he spends most of his first novel treading through. Outer Dark, with it's central incestuous conflict, could easily have been just another novel about screwed-up Appalachian degenerates. Instead it launches itself into a space of morbid ceremonies, nightmarish pseudo-myths, and inexplicable, cyclical violence. It's not southern Gothic or even american Gothic as much as it is Gothic period. It's easy to see the jumping off points for the themes he would explore in Blood Meridian, The Crossing, et al here.","The real launchpad for Mccarthy's subsequent work.

1,Pleased with All The Features,"I purchased Easy Media Creator 7 in late May and have been pleased with what I can do using all the features it has to offer. I enjoy traveling and taking lots of pictures with my digital camera, especially so I can create panorama photos. This used to take me forever to try to match and crop the overlapping photos using Adobe PhotoShop Elements. Now using the photo stitch capability found in the PhotoSuite application inside EMC7, I can effortlessly create seamless panorama pictures. That alone is worth the price of this program, but there's much more to report. I can also create great slide shows of all my pictures and then burn them to DVD or VCD. Once you try it, you'll be hooked like me.","Pleased with All The Features.

0,Find the old model if you can . . . .,"I was told this item was a must have when my older child was born (now three) and it was. We used it every night for two years and would have used it longer but there was no way to attach it to a bed. While in storage the water evaporated so when my second child was born I got the ""new and improved"" model . . . yuck!! The lights are brighter and the music is not a pleasant and soothing. The worst thing is the new design with the battery compartment as a separate piece that is clunky and doesn't always keep a good connection. If you touch the item or the crib the music goes off - very annoying.

1,Best Litter Pan Ever!,"Our cats love the XL Bill F litter pan, and so do we! The pans are great for cats who like live (ha ha) on the edge and keep the litter in the box where it belongs. The carbon filters work pretty well to keep odors down in small spaces and the pans are very easy to wash and dry. The latches are secure and robust and the anti-slip feet keep the unit in place. We also tried the Tapix mat, but it is not all that great at keeping scoopable litter that sticks to the cat's feet in the vicinity of the pan. As far as the litter pan goes, it's the best we've found.","Best Litter Pan Ever!. Our cats love the XL Bill F litter pan, and so do we!

0,Simply Deep - Not Deep Enough,"Although most of the songs are well written, Miss Rowland does not do the song writers justice. Her voice lacks depth and is not strong enough to carry a solo album (although nowadays, that doesn't seem to concern the music industry). With the negative press in the past concerning Destiny Child, Miss Rowland had to put out a solo project. My suggestion is more vocal training before attempting a sophmore project. I was hoping this project would put Miss Rowland on the map as a force to be reckon with as a female solo artist --- well, maybe next time.","Simply Deep - Not Deep Enough.

As soon a I put the battery in it was apparent that, as the clock was attempting to set itself, the minute hand was hanging up on the second hand. The first attempt did not set the clock to the local time, so I took the battery out and tried again. Same result except that this time the minute hand spun the second hand completely off leaving the second hand laying encased at the bottom of the clock. Needless to say I sent the clock back.","A disappointment. When I went looking for a wall clock to replace one that had broken, the Atomic feature and the low price both caught my eye.

0,Fair to average,"This is the book is pretty weak by Hiaasen's standards. I have read ""Double Whammy"", ""Tourist Season"", & ""Stormy Weather"", and this book stands below them. While Hiaasen excels in satire, and in both outlandish characters and stories, this book stretches that limit, and creates both characters and a story that are so absurd that it drags on and on. In his other books the central character at least has a semblance of normality to them that makes them easy to relate to, and keeps you interested in the story and how events unfold. In Lucky You, all of the characters lives are the extreme, and while events are amusing it goes overboard to the point that you lose interest. I have found myself putting this book down several times. The only thing that has me picking it back up, is that I have been a fan of Hiaasen's other books. So unless you're a diehard fan of Hiaasen's, I would suggest you skip this one, and move on to another book.","Fair to average. This is the book is pretty weak by Hiaasen's standards.

1,Interesting,"I found this to a very interesting book. I especially enjoyed the way the author presented the information, not as completed fact, rather as the latest working hypothesis that is standing up to the tests of science. He offered alternative points of view and stated things clearly enough that layman, such as myself, could understand them. The controversial aspects of the book are actually fairly treated in contrast with what people have said about it. It does drag a bit in parts as some theories are explored in more detail than my interest could sustain. All in all, fascinating and informative.","Interesting.

0,Boring. Just boring,"Ok, before I become a noob in the eyes of many, this is MY opinion. Listen or do not. My first experience seemed hopeful. I got into a good group, and played for a bit. Then things went down hill. The quests (missions in SGW) are boring and repetitive, and don't think about your levels. You will be tricked into attacking nests full of powerful beasts, or sent to deliver a package halfway across a planet. Most people hang out in taverns, bars, and cantinas, and do not actually embark on missions. Furthermore, it takes a excruciatingly long time to actually gain new skills or master a class, and most of the classes are unfun (a entertainer's sole job is to hit a key which caused him/her to dance on screen), or require endless monster kills to gain a single small bonus. For a newbie, this game is hell. For a casual gamer, it is frustrating. For a powergamer, it can be occasionally rewarding","Boring. Just boring.

1,This solved my problem completely!,"I'm a younger adult, who other than changing a toilet flapper every few years, had no idea how to repair a toilet. Well, my older(probably from the 70's when the house was built) toilet started running into the issue of filling up extremely slow. I did online research and found out that one of the solutions could be replacing the entire fill valve.Well, Fluidmaster's name kept coming up and I found it at my local hardware store. I decided to just do a complete repair job, so I purchased this kit(flapper included), as well as a new vinyl water line, as my original one looked past it's prime.Needless to say, after some fumbling with adjusting the shank on the new valve, everything was replaced, and not only does the toilet bowl fill up super fast again, but the flush is more powerful.I enjoy learning DIY stuff, as I'm a young adult who will eventually move on his own, so this was a helpful learning experience.","This solved my problem completely!.

1,"Simple, elegant, and it works!","After a week of researching all the bluetooth car kit options; I decided to go with the simple approach. The HF-33W has a small foot print, simple design yet very functional(three buttons), and complements my car's interior nicely (07 MS3). After about month of use, I find the noise suppression/echo canceling technology works great and the 2watt speakers is sufficient at max volume with windows open or radio on. Also, no complaints from others during calls. So far it has paired automatically with my phone (LG vx9900 and Moto V710) %100 of the time in about 2 seconds. In addition it works great with turn by turn voice navigation via phone GPS feature. It automatically turns on/off/pairs with the cars ignition (depends on car model).","Simple, elegant, and it works!.

0,a dreadful translation of classic work,"do NOT purchase this translation. it makes one of the funniest writers of all time boring. this translation is as bad as the previous reviewers have indicated. the best, and most hilarious, translation that i've seen is a 1938 version that , i think, eugene o'neill worked on as an editor or something. however, aristophanes should definitely be checked out by afficionados of ancient greek literature as well as anyone interested in comic writing that'll make you laugh out loud. he's one of the titans of world literature.","a dreadful translation of classic work. do NOT purchase this translation. it makes one of the funniest writers of all time boring. this translation is as bad as the previous reviewers have indicated. the best, and most hilarious, translation that i've seen is a 1938 version that , i think, eugene o'neill worked on as an editor or something. however, aristophanes should definitely be checked out by afficionados of ancient greek literature as well as anyone interested in comic writing that'll make you laugh out loud. he's one of the titans of world literature."
1,Outstanding and eye-opening,"This book is straightforward and challenging. We who are believers cannot compartmentalize our beliefs about the origin of man and all that exists if we want to be authentic. If we have been born anew by the Spirit of God into His kingdom, have thus become His children, we know the Bible is the Word of God. If we know the Bible is the Word of God, we know sin and death did not enter the world until after man had sinned. There could not have been eons of death before man appeared on the scene.This book is chockful of information which every Christian needs to know and understand. I highly recommend it to every believer who is serious about de-compartmentalizing his or her life so that the mind and soul are completely renewed by the transforming power of God's Word. (Romans 12:1-2)","Outstanding and eye-opening. This book is straightforward and challenging.

1,Great product,"Very nice, heavy duty product. I converted a 22"" LCD TV into a computer monitor and, consequently, I wanted to be able to change the elevation and angle of the screen accordingly. As it's a TV, not a monitor, it's a bit on the ""heavy"" side so I was concerned about stability. The stand is adjustable for weight, holds the TV fine, and I have no concerns about the TV tipping over. Great product (but probably a little too ""heavy duty"" for a small computer monitor), especially if you're attaching it to a TV or a heavy computer monitor.","Great product.

0,"Not bad, not great....","As other reviewers have stated, this is a good book for a broad, superficial review, however, the cognitive, experimental, and diagnostic sections are not sufficient prep for the GRE exam - they are too basic and brisk and do not reflect what is actually on the exam.

I honestly don't know how anyone takes this seriously! Its just not that funny, and tries way too hard. The only reason it was even published as a book suitable for grownups is because the Eddings' have a great track record, and their name sells, even if the plot is about as complicated as ""Bad god wants to unmake the world and good god wants to stop him"" can get. Every person they come across is either helpful and friendly and clever, or wicked and clever. And it's immediately obvious which is which. I mean, really people? Terry put it so eloquently...

I don't think I can return a chewed up toy, so now after 5 minutes of use I'm out 5$.I've had a few other rope toys that lasted anywhere from a week to a month. The rope on this one is just softer, its not hard, was way too easy for a dog to chew through.Would not recommend.","Lasted 5 minutes..

1,Great investment,Mine has been a wise investment if it broke today. I bought mine around 18 years ago just after I saw them on tv. Some people snickered and said it was junk when I ordered it but I did anyway to save money. I had to get frequent haircuts since I was in the military and it was worth trying. It only cost around $50 back then. Others laughed when I told them how I cut my hair but never said it looked bad. It is still going strong and it has worked without any repairs all these years. I have even cut a few others hairDownside is I still need some regular clippers to do over the ears and the to of the neck but it does well on the longer hair on top.Worth the money!11111,Great investment.

It only cost around $50 back then. Others laughed when I told them how I cut my hair but never said it looked bad. It is still going strong and it has worked without any repairs all these years. I have even cut a few others hairDownside is I still need some regular clippers to do over the ears and the to of the neck but it does well on the longer hair on top.Worth the money!11111

1,The cutest movie!,"Kiki's Delivery Service is the cutest movie I've seen yet! I've seen this and Princess Mononoke, and from what I can tell Miyazaki is one of the best animators ever! In this, Kiki, with the help of her over-cautious, complaining cat Jiji, must learn to live all on her own. With the help of the town bakers, she sets up a delivery service. Things go super for a while, then she loses her witch's powers, which include flying, the most essential factor of her ability to do her job! She can hardly make her deliveries on time, and is having a really hard time coping. She even breaks her trusty broom and can no longer understand Jiji. When her friend, Tombo, is in serious trouble (hanging from on out-of-control derigible!) she must re-find her powers to fly and save him.","The cutest movie!.

1,Nice winter boots.,"I had a pair of these (with the taller ankle) from Cabellas long before UGGs got popular. I loved how comfy they were, but the winter before last they took their last wear. So I had to buy some new ones. These are not as comfy as my old, but they are perfect for me for the price. I like that they are lower on the ankle, because I hate when they are tight on my calves. Although if you have skinny calves, I think the taller boots are much cuter!","Nice winter boots.. I had a pair of these (with the taller ankle) from Cabellas long before UGGs got popular.

0,Could be better,"This book can be adequate for a beginner but for an intermediate or a more advanced trainer it is no good. Especially it lacked exact descriptions of many moves, and in vain it classifies many moves as 'advanced' although there is nothing 'advanced' in them.

Additionally, weight training nutrition should be covered in much more detail. I think the next edition of this book could benefit from having a male author among the authors (nothing against female writers really).

0,"Asimple REVIEW of us, ROger Ling, RAymond Gao,& Jonathan Bau","Dear Friends, WE have read this book, and other reviews, and WE have made a conclusion for myself. This book is a visionary, it leaves you open mouthed and sleeping (drooling too.)... although it seems to contain good topics such as friendship and love in the book, it is SO scrambled that the book turns into a jumbling piece of literature. The book contains random events that have nothing to do with each other, yet somehow Barbara Kingsolver uses extremely bad writing and a strong Tucson accent to tie all the events together. All in all, WE,Roger Ling, RAymond Gao, and Jonathan Bau appreciate the hard effort that Kingsolver put into this ""interestingly unique"" book, but next time she wants to write another book alike this one, we shall say, ""Thanks, but no thanks. Think of the future generations."" P.S. WE were unable to finish the book due to the book's lack of quality.","Asimple REVIEW of us, ROger Ling, RAymond Gao,& Jonathan Bau.

0,Dangerous for kids,"Got the guitar, but the store didnt send the Amp with it, so I am returning it. While I was checking for the amp, saw the guitar and notices how sharp the frets were. The jagged edges on the frets on the guitar neck are sure to cut a childs fingers. I am surprised someone is even allowed to sell that kind of stuff without looking at child safety first. I play the guitar and bass, and I cant picture anyone playing this instrument without cutting their fingers as the move their hands across the neck. Bad worksmanship on this. It did look cute for my son though. I'd hate for his first guitar experience to be painful and discourage him from playing more.","Dangerous for kids.

1,Bowflex Treadmill,This is a well built machine. The motor is quiet and there are plenty of workout programs to chose from. I researched before buying and Consumer Reports rated this treadmill one of their Best Buys. I had a cheaper treadmill prior to this one and by far this is a much more excellent product. Although it is somewhat expensive you must spend this type of money to get a quality product otherwise you will continue to buy treadmills that have short life spans. I cannot rate the customer service issue as I have not yet had a need for that. I registered the product on line and the warranty is a good one.,Bowflex Treadmill. This is a well built machine.

1,You can't go back to Kansas,"In July 1975 Noel Edmonds, the breakfast DJ on National Radio 1 here in the UK, made "" July, You're a Woman "" his record of the week. It didn't make it a chart topper,but it did make me go out and by this album. I virtually wore out my vinyl copy over the next 23 years and replaced it with CD at the end of 1998. I have played this album in one format or another every week since 1975 and never tired of it. I just wish I'd been there...Classic songs that are nostalgic without becoming dated and that still make me think new things, even after all these years. For me John Stewart is the greatest of the American singer songwriters and this album is one of his best. Listen, marvel and then explore the rest of his oeuvre.","You can't go back to Kansas.

0,Buyer Beware!,"We love this game....when it works. The graphics are great and Tonka Joe is a nice addition to help kids navigate through all the different tasks. I have tried this game on three different computers I own; a generic, a Gateway, and a brand new Dell. I have also tried this game under three different o/s; Win 95, 98se, and XP. It has never worked well on any of them. You are more likely to arrange a meeting with the Pope on Easter than you are to reach any customer support people that are helpful. My son shed tears three different times while trying to get this game to work. I have spent untold hours trying different tactics and downloading updates to run this game error free. I have requested a new cd three times only to be told to try some other fix first. Unfortunately, we have the controls for the game, but no game. We have put the controls and the cd to good use. My son likes to pretend he is playing the game with the controls, and the cd has become our new indoor frisbee.","Buyer Beware!. We love this game....when it works.

0,I have to say that the Spirit did not move me...,"...while reading this book. Part of the problem was the writing, which seemed more on the level of a young adult novel (and not a particularly well-written one), part was the lackluster characterization, and part was the fact that the story just wasn't very compelling. Two things in particular bothered me...(1) The relatively small disruption that the Rapture caused in the world, since people seemed to pick right up and carry on, as though nothing of import had happened.(2) The lack of power in the descriptions of various individual conversion experiences. I've done more spiritual soul searching when I started a diet than these people appear to do before repenting and accepting Christ.I also thought the names were pretty silly, as someone else noted, and that Nicolae was a boring villain. I won't be reading any of the sequels.","I have to say that the Spirit did not move me.... ...while reading this book.

1,As described except....,the plastic covering is driving me crazy! I am one of those people who hates when price tags don't come off. In this case the metal clip was added to the item after the black board was wrapped in plastic. It is stuck under there. I even used a razor blade to cut around some of it but the clip works so well and is so tight that there is no way to get under there to even attempt to cut out the plastic. I would have given it 5 stars IF I could have removed all of the packaging.,As described except..... the plastic covering is driving me crazy!

One night when the human Palmer family is asleep Annabelle goes to look for Auntie Sarah, but instead of Auntie Sarah, she finds a doll family named the Funcrafts.

A few of my other faves are ""Young Girl's Blues"", ""What Have They Done to the Rain?"", ""Come and Stay with Me"" and ""Portland Town"".The one song that I wish were not included here (or anywhere for that matter) is her version of ""Monday, Monday"". This also includes her last London label 45rpm, the wonderfully odd choice ""Is This What I Get For Loving You?"", penned by Phil Spector and originally recorded by The Ronettes.If you're a true Marianne Faithfull fan, you may already have most of these in some incarnation, if you are just discovering her earlier works, GET THIS COLLECTION!","MARIANNE'S SWEETEST OF THE '60'S.

0,Bad fit for Demi Moore,"I recently watched this movie, hoping to see a quality rendition of Hawthorne's classic novel, but I was disappointed with Moore's performance. I'm used to seeing Moore in action roles such as G.I. Jane and Charlie's Angels II, so it just didn't see like a good fit for her to be playing a stuffy Puritan. I couldn't take her role seriously in the Scarlett Letter, particularly with her accent. I just about gagged in one scene where she says, ""Reverend Dimmesdale, I must apologize for my forthrighteousness on Sabbath last..."" Um, does that mean, ""I'm sorry I was so blunt last Sunday""?This movie would be so much better to watch with a different acress.","Bad fit for Demi Moore.

0,Preposterous Excuse for a Book: Shameful,"""The Egyptian Origin of Christianity"" is incoherent. It's perfectly clear that an editor's pencil never touched a page of this self-published manuscript. It's equally clear the author is incapable of writing either transitional sentences or paragraphs. It would be more than generous to suggest this 'book' was a first draft; however it tracks more like a stack of note cards dropped on the floor and then recovered by a very diligent typist. I am disgusted that Amazon would participate in a business relationship with a vanity house without warning its customers that they might well be ordering incoherent trash.","Preposterous Excuse for a Book: Shameful.

1,not a country music fan,"But the 'old timey music' on this album bears no relationship to the dreck that comes off the airwaves. The songs are clean and pure, the harmonies amazing. Unsentimental, but full of emotion, each song is a pleasure to hear over and over. The harmonies (on alison krauss's songs in particular) sound fresh and new, and at the same time as if they had existed for a century somewhere in the American consciousness. None of this music seems to have been written, it all grew naturally from some soul plant that ranged over fifty years ago from deep in the Appalachians down to the Louisiana mud.","not a country music fan.

The director did not see what this story was all about. There is a scene when Faust is in the grave that kinda rings of the comic. If you read the comic book you will be searching for small scenes that you remember but they are far and few between. I am still a big fan of the comic, the movie on the other had is a mess.

In the beginning, the book is a little slow, and then the adventure picks up, and then slows down again at the end. I also thought that the book was on the harder side; there are lots of characters to remember and some of them have the very similar names, so sometimes it can become just a little confusing. I would not recommend this book to others because it wasn't interesting and it wasn't a page-turner.

0,Great game if you are a racing engineer or professional driver.,"Great graphics, but the in game options really made the experience weak. The arcade version (the only level I could even begin to handle)was still quite difficult in terms of driving physics (simulator mode being nearly impossible), and had very limited play options, i.e. not allowing a race against a full field of cars. WHY NOT??? That's lame!Since I don't have hundreds of hours to study racing like an engineer, and even more hundreds of hours to spend playing a stupid game, I much prefer the arcade like action of the Need for Speed series.

This one, however, he enjoys. It's an alphabet book as only Chris Van Allsburg could do it--theatrical, eerie, and lots of fun. Dramatic things happen to each of the letters. The W is warped, the Z is zapped and so forth. Many of the concepts, such as warping and disappearing, are rather abstract, so this is probably not the first alphabet book you want to use with your children. But once you are past the ""A is for apple"" stage, this book is marvelous. Terrific for vocabulary-building. I've seen it showcased at several teacher conventions.","The alphabet as only Chris Van Allsburg could do it!. I am a huge fan of Chris Van Allsburg and own several of his books.

And sure 'nuff, I can tell a difference between a glass of riesling, even *cheap* riesling, by drinking it out of this glass. (My major experiment was using a bottle of wine that was merely okay. The glass made it a *better* okay. I think it still ended up in a fondue.)The glasses are just a tiny bit fragile for everyday use, but I'm comparing them to heavy juice clunkers rather than a wine glass. They do make my morning juice look cool. If you're thinking of them for wine service, though, they don't seem quite as elegant as stemware... on the other hand, it'll be a lot harder to knock one of these over.","Also good for your morning orange juice.

1,This thing actually works!,"My mom has a bad wrist, so I got this for her. I figured it would be easier for her to use than a traditional Rabbit opener and it is. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of it, but it does work! My only gripe is that it's huge! Also, the red light doesn't seem to go out or change to a different color when charged. I plugged it in for at least 10 hours and it always glowed red. I can't believe that a small item like a wine opener would require more than 10 hours of charging, but there was nothing to indicate that it was fully charged. But the bottom line is that it actually works and comes with a foil cutter and chiller. I got this on a lightning deal for $16 and it was definitely worth that. Would I have spent $24? Not sure.","This thing actually works!. My mom has a bad wrist, so I got this for her. I figured it would be easier for her to use than a traditional Rabbit opener and it is.

This 20 year old kid, Francis Ouimet, a amateur golfer from Boston, takes on the best two golfers in the world and kicks butt....wins the U.S. Open! Unbelievable.

0,wanted to like it.. but cant,"this movie is a waist of time.. i think they put Peter Jacksons name on it so they could sell it..the first half is like a documentary with horrid low budget actors.. the aliens who live in the ""shanty"" town are silly... they have elements of ghetto thugs but trying to be cute about it.. then the main character who completely unbelievable becomes half alien and fight the humans.. who are imprisoning the aliens for 2 decades blah blah.. its a steaming pile of crap... save your money and rent it at a red box thing for a dollar.. the only thing good was the last 15 minutes or so.. the action/killing scenes are kinda cool.. just not worth buying to own.. trust me im sorry i did","wanted to like it.. but cant. this movie is a waist of time.. i think they put Peter Jacksons name on it so they could sell it..the first half is like a documentary with horrid low budget actors.. the aliens who live in the ""shanty"" town are silly... they have elements of ghetto thugs but trying to be cute about it.. then the main character who completely unbelievable becomes half alien and fight the humans.. who are imprisoning the aliens for 2 decades blah blah.. its a steaming pile of crap... save your money and rent it at a red box thing for a dollar.. the only thing good was the last 15 minutes or so.. the action/killing scenes are kinda cool.. just not worth buying to own.. trust me im sorry i did"

1,Relief for my dogs!,"I didn't really buy these for the shedding benefits. I was mostly looking for an omega supplement for my dog that was chewable, and not in a gel capsule. My dog had a slipped disc and was in constant pain. My vet said omega 3 can help with arthritis so I decided to get these. My dog also had itchy skin, and was constantly scratching, so I thought this would help with that too.I was pretty astounded when my dog's arthritis went away pretty quickly, within days. Also, my dog no longer scratches as frequently, and her fur is very silky now. I noticed the difference in her skin and fur rather quickly as well. I was pleasantly surprised since supplements can take a while to become effective. I would definitely not go without these anymore! This product has definitely provided much needed relief to my dog. Also, my dog likes the flavor too, unlike other omega supplements.","Relief for my dogs!. I didn't really buy these for the shedding benefits.

0,Clash of the 80's Hair Band,"Having enjoyed the original back when it came out, I was keen to see the remake with potentially stunning graphics. I was quite disappointed with the CGI effects. The scorpion battle scenes were murky and claustrophobic. The only bright spot, image-wise, was the Medusa battle; a glimpse of what the whole movie should have looked like. The Kraken - yawn. In summary - stick with the original, or avoid both altogether. Oh yeah, and how do you make Liam Neeson look like an 80's hair band outcast.","Clash of the 80's Hair Band.

You only really get 9 containers (the 18 pieces refers to the containers and the lids) and because we make all sorts of dressings in addition to cooking all the time, I have been known to use almost all 9 pieces at once.The only cons of this product: the containers are relatively heavy and not totally leak-proof.","Pyrex is safe, non-toxic and effective!.

1,Help and Healing,"I bought this book after suddenly losing my beloved cat Tootie to kidney disease. I was having a horrible time, because I was away on a trip across the country when the vet recommended euthanasia for her. Although I had a wonderful cat sitter, I suffered because I was not with Tootie when she died. The book helped me immensely with my guilt and my sorrow. I recommend it to anyone who is dealing with the loss of a loved pet.","Help and Healing. I bought this book after suddenly losing my beloved cat Tootie to kidney disease.

1,Greatly improves indoor flash pictures.,"If you're serious about getting good indoor flash pictures, then something like the DF200 is a must.Use it to *properly* light up subjects at medium to longer distances (something dinky built-in flashes don't have the power for) or use bounce flash at closer distances. I absolutely love how bounced flash evenly lights the people in my photos. You can also turn down the ISO setting, allowing for less grainy photos.The hold button is handy when there are other cameras around you snapping away, but I do wish it was in the form of a switch, which would have been more durable then the small springy button it is currently. Also, the battery door can be a little bit difficult to open and close.Edit: By the way, it works perfectly fine on my Rebel XT/350D & Powershot A70","Greatly improves indoor flash pictures..

1,Musings on a broken-spined hardcover,"My copy is nearing 25 yrs old and shows the wear and tear of living in backpacks, suitcases, briefcases and brown paper bags. This compendium of 6 different books of Service's work will take you from his Gold Rush Days of the Yukon, to his escape to the Bohemian Quarter in Paris to become a 'Serious Poet', and to his volunteering to become an ambulance driver for the Red Cross in the First World War. His ballads are remarkable in how they take you deeply into the the person's life for that brief time as you read. There is the lighthearted comedy he is known for with ""The Cremation of Sam McGee"", as well as the first person accounts of the unimaginable horrors and uplifting glories of battle in the trenches. Service wrote for the everyday working man, in everything he is utterly approachable and unpretentious. I will confess, as does he, this is ""lowbrow stuff"", but it is mighty satisfying.","Musings on a broken-spined hardcover.

0,2 years later,"This is a good toothbrush and you won't have to buy replacements for the 6-10 months. While brushing, it works best to progress slowly from tooth to tooth without trying to brush back and forth or in circles. It definitely does better than regular brushing but my checkups are not better than before I started using the brush. The back teeth and the gumline seemed to be missed more but the main surfaces feel smoother. After 2 years, the battery is not holding charge well anymore and the charge indicator LED lights only dimly. Overall, I would say it is worth it but I want to see if there is something better. I am going to buy a Sonicare.","2 years later. This is a good toothbrush and you won't have to buy replacements for the 6-10 months.

0,Not a Match for Peg Perego,"Got one as a gift and now have to return it. It is not as ""universal"" as it states. The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with. The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar. The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly. It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller.","Not a Match for Peg Perego. Got one as a gift and now have to return it.

0,tantalizing idea poorly executed,"As a great fan of Afropop in general, and of the overall Six Degrees-type approach to things, this one looked like a no-brainer. Like the other reviewer, though, I came away disappointed. There is certainly enough African material for Six Degrees-type remixes to last until the next century, and I think such projects are potentially very worthwhile, but the source material used here doesn't seem all that strong. Of course, it's kind of hard to tell because a thick gauze of electronic mush is draped over the whole proceedings. I don't hear anything innovative or inspired here, which is a real shame because the concept has such fantastic and varied possibilities. This one strikes out, but I hope Six Degrees pursues it in the future with the same vigor they've given South American treatments, for example.","tantalizing idea poorly executed.

1,Nice blades,"I bought a pack of these to go with a new Dewalt hacksaw frame. They fit and work well, are easy to spot when dropped (thanks to the bright yellow paint job), and are reasonably priced. This model has fewer teeth per inch for a cut that is a bit rougher, but quicker, than higher teeth per inch versions.","Nice blades. I bought a pack of these to go with a new Dewalt hacksaw frame.

1,A great digital camera for the money,"I received this camera for Christmas and have already taken close to 300 photos on the supplied batteries. By the way, Amazon had the lowest price of all the on-line places I looked and they even shipped it free! Thus far, I'm very impressed with the color accuracy in this camera. The feature I needed most was fast shutter speed (fidgety grandkids) and it delivers nicely. However, the feature that surprised me most was the anti-shake which is excellent when in the telephoto mode. I was able to take photos of cars in front of us while traveling as a passenger at 75 mph on the interstate in full telephoto mode and could read license plates very clearly in the photos! I highly recommend buying the lens adapter ring which is very inexpensive and which allows you to add filters, telephoto and wide angle lenses to this camera to make it even more versatile. I find the controls to be intuitive and user friendly and in the auto mode, my wife can take great pictures.","A great digital camera for the money.

This just might be the worst horror film or any film I've ever seen. The story was written by a child, the so called actors couldn't get a job doing dinner theater, the special FX were weak and low budget to say the least and the direction was non-existant!!! The only redeeming qualities of the movie, and this is by a long stretch, are the shooting locations and scenery. It was set in Ireland but was shot in Connecticut and the locations are the only saving grace in this film. At least the DP shot great scenery and captured the beauty of Ireland.I would rate this film a 1/2 star on a 5 star scale. VERY BAD!!!!!!","Plaque Town.

1,It's worth more than the shirt.,"They got it in one. The sound that college kids flock toward, and The Shirts nail it on the first try. This CD was a big surprise for me. I had never heard of these guys until I saw their album in a Christian music store. I took a complete chance on it, but it was okay because it was free, and besides, being a Christian band, they're worth at least a listen. What do you know; the gamble paid off again. These guys have a really great folksy sound (similar to that of Caedmon's Call), and on top of that, their lyrics are really smart and well-written. Ten Shekel Shirt isn't really well known, at least for now, but once people start checking them out, I think they will be before long. The standouts on this album for me were the title track (""Much"") and ""Meet With Me"". The Christian folk set has some nice new neighbors, and hopefully they'll stick around for a while.","It's worth more than the shirt.. They got it in one.

0,What a Disappointment!,"I usually love Lori Foster's novels, but this one was a disappointment from the very beginning. Her lead male character comes off as pushy and completely unbelievable from the onset of the story. From there the reader is led through a half baked story that ends so abruptly and half-finished that I kept wondering where Foster stuck the rest of her manuscript. She resolved the little half baked plot, but still left the characters dangling at the end. I hope her next one is better or I may have to start borrowing copies to read instead of actually buying them.","What a Disappointment!.

0,Content - Great . Production Quality of DVD - Garbage,"As a Price fan, I had to get these two classics. When the DVD arrived I anxiously poped it out of it's case, put it in the DVD player, and hit the play button. The sound was scratchy, there was an annoying white glow in the lower right corner of the screen, and the original film the DVD was produced from must have been used as a cat scratching post. I swear that the DVD was made from a video tape shot in a cinema off the moviue screen - it's that ad. At first I thought this was as good as the quality got for this movie. Then I saw it on the SciFi Channel - the quality was excellent, sound was perfect, etc.So if you want it for the movies, it's OK. As for quality, it's the WORST DVD I have seen to date - and I own over 150!","Content - Great . Production Quality of DVD - Garbage. As a Price fan, I had to get these two classics.

1,First time comic reader left very happy. 4.5 Stars.,"This is the first time I've read anything even resembling a comic book, and I really liked it. I decided to read it because my dad, who is pretty picky with what he reads, read this book and loved it, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm very happy I did.Don't go into this expecting it to be a light reading, cheesy super hero comic. This is a very serious novel of staggering depth, with lots of psychological elements and well defined characters. A surprisingly deep read.My only real complaint about this novel is that some of the attempts at humor are a little dry. For example, in the first chapter, someone says something to Rorschach along the lines of ""You have friends now? I guess you changed your deodorant."" luckily there are only a few little things like that. All that aside, it's a great, unpredictable read. Highly recommended, even if you've never read a graphic novel.","First time comic reader left very happy. 4.5 Stars..

1,It's nice but for me I had to split it,"I was buying 1mg on here because I read most people only need the low dosage, and boy did it make a difference. When I came back to buy more, the price had skyrocketed, and these were the best deal I could find. I don't like the tablets (not capsules) but for dissolving i suppose they are better. I planned on splitting them and taking half, but it's hard to split them easily because they aren't hard tablets, they kind of turn into powder. First night I took half, I didn't have any big noticeable difference from my previous ones (slept fine, fairly alert, worked fine). Last night I was in a rush and decided to take an entire one, and that was a big mistake. This morning I was sooo groggy and slept in, it was really hard to get up. My sleep seemed to be fine, because once I got up and was awake I was fine, but my morning took forever to come out of it and for it to work out of my system.","It's nice but for me I had to split it.

1,I like this new series.,"I liked this new Riley Jenson series. She is half werewolf, half vampire as is her twin brother Rhoan. Rhoan is a guardian for the Directorate, and Riley is an assistant guardian. Guardians are disappearing. Rhoan falls victim also, and Riley must find him. I liked the character Riley, she is very tough, funny, down to earth except when the moon is rising and then her werewolf beast must be sastisfied by having lots of sex with her designated lovers. The plot was good, plenty of action, great secondary characters that will surely continue on into the next books in this series. The sex became a little reminiscent of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake and her ardeur. But, not near as graphic, or as much. Thank goodness or I would have to stop reading this series, if it falls prey to being all the book is about. Otherwise, I enjoyed it, and will read the next books.","I like this new series..

After the first couple of uses it became evident that this is not meant for regular-sized batches of cookies or cake; it is simply too big for household use. The orbital beaters don't reach the bottom of the bowl so it is necessary to frequently stop the mixer, lower the bowl, remove the shield & spout, scrape with a spatula, raise the bowl, replace the shield and spout, and turn it back on. What a hassle! The only plus in my opinion is the all-metal construction. I sold mine on Craigslist and my next mixer will be a traditional two-beater type, metal or not.

And to be fair, they did a good job of not straying too far from the Biblical text.However, the acting is weak and the script worse, really bad at points. Dan Haggerty is the only one who can deliver a line and he has just a few. The characters all look like the came from Iowa, not the Middle East. Little things like all the clothes looking brand new and clean make it look more like a Sunday school play than a modern period piece.With a little better directing and a few different actors, this could have been pretty good. Don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed.","Disappointed. I really wanted to like this movie.

1,Just Saw Prince Last Night!!!,"I just saw Prince in concert last night in Raleigh, NC. In spite of the fact that he has toned down his sexual antics on the stage, he is still one of the most sensual and soulful performers of all time. They were handing out this CD upon entry to the concert so I didn't really expect it to be that good. I have been listening to it today and the more I hear it, the more I like it. It just grooves you! I especially love ""On the Couch"" and ""Call My Name"". These are so reminiscent of the music that my generation made out to, but the lyrics aren't nearly as raw. The base and drums are awesome on many of the tracks. He showcases his guitar playing skills a little more than in the past, but still not enough. I wish he would put out an acoustic album to let his fans hear what we heard in concert. He's still got it!","Just Saw Prince Last Night!!!. I just saw Prince in concert last night in Raleigh, NC.

There were so many episodes there was no need for extras.They were the same old episodes, but different. Different names, different jokes, slightly different plots. I laughed my butt off at some of the cut scenes. I certainly hope they weren't cut for violence. Ed, Edd and Eddy is more violent than Sailor Moon.

0,Wishful thinking,"I tried this product after the product I had been using for 6 years, oxy Maximum Vanish Lotion, was discontinued. With the oxy lotion my skin was FLAWLESS.

1,"Amazing, simply amazing.","I bought these for my mp3 since the headphones I have were falling to pieces, stock ones that came with it. I saw these had good reviews and were cheap so I thought I'd give them a try. They're amazing.. I used them to listen to music on my computer and the bass is clear, the highs are clear, the lows are clear. I hate to say this but these sound better then my $70 creative labs speakers. I play Counter Strike Source as well and I can hear a shell drop from a gun from across a map, the smallest footstep and I can hear it. Its quite amazing. They're a little uncomfortable at first, but that's just because my ears weren't used to earbuds going in. I'd recommend them to anyone who wants a good, inexpensive pair of earbuds.","Amazing, simply amazing..

The video transfer is supposedly ""restored"", but you would never know it. The Most Dangerous Game was watchable, but certain scenes were very washed out with lots of dirt and scratches. I had even worse success with The Vampire Bat. The movie started ok, but my DVD player actually had trouble reading the disk about mid-way through. It got so bad, that I had to stop watching the movie. If your main interest in this disk is, The Most Dangerous Game (by far the superior of the two films), then I suggest the Criterion release.","Good movies, but substandard quality.

0,May have been good in its day,"I cannot agree with the other reviewers on this. Back in the days when there were hardly any general texts on topology this may have been good.

Bush and his entertaining give-and-take with the press while traveling aboard his campaign plane.When speaking of Al Gore, Bruni writes, ""He(Bush) made it clear that he saw Gore as equal parts pompous blowhard and preening chameleon, a spineless panderer ready to be anything for anyone.

1,It's The Brick,"This is the nicest standard zoom lens you'll find. It's sharp, high-contrast, and low aberration at nearly all zoom levels and apertures. If you're going to step your toes into Canon's L line, this is the place to start. Giving you five standard focal lengths (24, 28, 35, 50, and 70 mm) this lens is an ideal high-quality everyday lens. Further, the quiet USM autofocuses nearly instantly, and the full-time manual focus ring rotates like butter.If I had to pick one problem with this, it would be the weight. At about 2.5lbs, it's surprisingly heavy, especially when you've been wielding it for several hours. Also, it's immense size grabs the attention of strangers, which depending on what you're doing, could be problematic.But in the end, when what I'm doing demands high quality and versatility, this is the lens I rely on.

It is the standard-zoom staple of my travel pack, and if limited to only what's attached to the camera, this is the lens that comes."

1,"Recommended for every ""hard gainer""!","This is a great book for anyone interested in improving their physique, especially after failing in convential methods. However, the book will be sometimes hard to understand for anyone not previously exposed to weight training and familiar with a lot of the terms and procedures involved. Also, the author keeps stressing the need for correct technique throughout this book, but never gives details on technique for even the major exercises. In my opinion it is necessary to also buy ""Insider's tell-all handbook to weight-training technique"" by the same author to make full use of ""Beyond Brawn"".","Recommended for every ""hard gainer""!.

I find this interaction to be totally archaic so I was totally unimpressed by this gameplay. Also, after you have clicked on all of the options on how to communicate with the character and you click on goodbye, as you are leaving the character will say, ""Can I help you"", or something to that affect.

It also suggests not buying prepared food for your dog, instead feeding her raw food which is the only type to contain ""life energy"".

This is a good short-term, temporary saw if that's what you need. Not too many hours after use, mine wouldn't stay running after it was warm. Checked the air filter and replaced the plug, and still nothing. Finally last year, after very light yearly use, it would no longer start. I even tried replacing all of the fuel hoses and filter with a kit I bought, but none of that worked. The old saying is true: Buy cheap, buy twice.","Two stars tops.

0,Reckless and rotten book for kids,"Unfortunately, I bought each book for my seven year old son. Even he could not believe how ""horrible"" Henry behaved with absolutely NO consequences.

These books are so deplorable I will not pass along to friends or donate. They will end up in the garbage where they belong. Reckless content pretty much sums it up.

0,wow - ! this guy is slow...,"The premise of the story is interesting in the same way maybe Jurassic Park makes you wonder - ""It would be neat if it could be true."" But the main character in this book is so slow to catch on. He has this arsenal of people who are excellent at their jobs of finding information for him and yet, he doesnt seem to know what to do with what he uncovers. As the reader, I found myself getting progressively irritated at Joe Lassiter. He was always at a loss. He was single minded about finding the Grimaldi character and dismissing an important connection to his riddle.If this was the authors style of 'suspense' - it left me irritated.Next time, find a smarter hero.","wow - ! this guy is slow....

That said, this book was horribly boring. I'm not a light reader - just look at my other reviews - but I couldn't even begin to get into this book. Nothing interested me in the least, and after giving the book a try for less than twenty-four hours, I finally had to just take it back.

0,Very disappointing thermometer from Amazon,"I liked my last Taylor mini-maxi thermometer, so, when I needed one for my new greenhouse, I bought a Taylor again. This one has bad design (you are forced to grip it in such a way as to put pressure on the tube, easily pushing it out of the plastic retaining clips). The long vertical red button, supposedly for resetting, doesn't work. It has never worked. The magnet is difficult to get out of its storage space. One of the two black markers is now permanently stuck down in the mercury, and does not budge in response to the magnet. It would be hard to find a way to make a more worthless thermometer for those who need to know minimum and maximum temperatures over a 24-hour period.","Very disappointing thermometer from Amazon.

0,Meh.,"I concur with the other mediocre reviews - this one felt like the author's editor went on vacation and didn't finish her job. Aside from the broad problems of plot (or lack thereof), character development and dialogue (I read to avoid having mundane conversations with significant others, I don't want to have to read them in my books), the author has an annoying habit of heavy-handedly foreshadowing future events. I LOVED her first book, but this one felt like a rush job for a looming deadline. Skip it.","Meh..

0,how disappointing...,"The only other of Toibin's books that I have read was ""The Master"", which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is brilliantly subtle; my slight and confusing attraction to Henry James has, probably, more than something to do with my reaction. My thought was that such a profound writer should have a few more equally enjoyable books under his belt. I was, at least as concerns this work, horribly mistaken. I did try to like this book. I kept waiting for some depth or maybe some honest emotion. What I got was intolerably lackluster 1st person in short 7 word sentences that drove me /batty/, and a 'love' that is more based on lust than anything else. There is not one drop of feeling anywhere, and this includes the protagonist's reactions to his political situation since he doesn't actually /care/ at all. I skimmed to the end of the book to see if maybe I might be missing something worthwhile, but found nothing that would have made this book worth having bought in the 1st place.","how disappointing....

0,"Nice weekly format, but negative and worrisome","The week by week format makes the book easy to read, however I have found many unnecessary and worry-provoking entries which really turned me off from the book. For example, every week has a section ""How Your Actions Affect Your Baby's Development"". In one of the early weeks, this section is entirely about different types of miscarriage, which made me wonder if Dr. Curtis is somehow implying that all misarriages are caused by women's actions? Further on, there are sonogram pictures of a tumor as well as a knot in the umbilical cord, without any note that such conditions are extremely rare. What the point is of including these anxiety-provoking points, I do not know. As well, Dr. Curtis seems to take a rather traditional medical viewpoint to pregnancy. Overall, I found the book to be more bothersome than helpful, both in its lack of explanation of some dangers and its overabundance of worry-provoking entries. I would not recommend this book.","Nice weekly format, but negative and worrisome.

0,Who's the Dummy?,"I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).I wish I had not bothered and kept my 14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.The CD accompanying the book is a joke, and if this is an example of the author's musical skill I shudder to think what else he has produced. The irritating keyboard rhythms and styles are a throw back to the Bontempi school of music.IMO this book is pants and is not worthy to carry the name Piano in its title. Save your money and don't buy it, there are lots of other very good ""easy books"" on teaching beginners the piano.","Who's the Dummy?.

1,No Fuss Beard Trimming,"I had a previous model Norelco for 4 years and it was great, until the battery finally died a few weeks ago. I thought I would be clever and buy another manufacturer's vacuum-trimmer in a brick-and-mortar store. It was awful. The vacuum barely worked and if I didn't hold the trimmer perfectly aligned with your face the cut was very uneven. I returned it and bought the Norelco T990 from Amazon. It is fantastic! The flexing head of the trimmer means that I get an even trim every time, no matter what angle I hold the trimmer. Its so reliable that I don't really even need to use a mirror. I really like the charge indicator as well. I don't have to guess if its time to charge the trimmer. The pop-up trimmer isn't the best or most convenient, and the ""deluxe"" case isn't as deluxe as it sounds. However, those are minor gripes. Overall, this is an excellent beard trimmer.","No Fuss Beard Trimming. I had a previous model Norelco for 4 years and it was great, until the battery finally died a few weeks ago.

1,"""The Other Wise Man"" brings a very special gift.","When I was 12 years old, my Sunday school teacher gave me a book for Christmas. The book, written in 1896 by Henry van Dyke, was The Story of the Other Wise Man. It tells the story of a fourth Magi, Artaban. This ""other wise man"" saw the same heavenly signs that told his friends, Caspar, Melchior and Balthazar, of the arrival of the Christ Child. Artaban has his own gifts (a sapphire, a ruby and a pearl) to present to Jesus, but, while hastening to join his friends, Artaban stops to aid a dying man and is left behind. He spends the rest of his life in a search for Christ, but each time he comes close to his goal, he is sidetracked by the need to help another human being. Not much longer than a long short story, The Story of the Other Wise Man is the perfect book for reading aloud with the family this holiday season.","""The Other Wise Man"" brings a very special gift..

My son Knows hes not real (he's got a mind like a scientist, you have to physically show him things or he just doesn't believe.

1,Excellent but exhausting,"The paperback is bound to be a lot less awkward and unwieldy. But the used copies of the hardbound are dirt cheap. I bought the hardbound.Each of the selections are very short, dramatic and intense. I found it hard to read more than a couple of them at a sitting.Of course the selection is skewed to include a lot of British explorers.The inclusion of a number of anecdotes about the deaths of explorers, usually either by starvation of hostile natives, got tiresome. You really got the feeling you were being sold martyrdom stories, that these guys were martyrs for civilization.But apart from these minor criticisms, this is an outstanding collection and many of the selections make you want to go and find the full versions of the original sources. I did this with respect to Rene Caillie's Timbuctoo journey, for example. Many of the sources are out of print, but they can be found for free in PDF form on Google Books and other archive sites.","Excellent but exhausting.

0,Disappointing,"Having read 1901 I was expecting more of this book. Basically his premise is England joins the war on the Confederate side and suddenly the Union makes all the right moves. Little to no research, shoddy writing and told from only one point of view. Throw in the authors version of a romance novel in the middle and you've got 1862. Good starting point for an alternate history but downhill from there.","Disappointing. Having read 1901 I was expecting more of this book.

1,Satisfied,"Other than one of the two screws needed to install this product was missing, I have no issues. The problem was in packaging, as a small crinkled piece of tape was used to stick the loose screws to the back of the plastic crusher. Then the shipping box had cracks in it, so the screw apparently came loose and fell out during shipping. Missing hardware seems to be the norm these days no matter where you purchase products. So far the crusher works great. Time will tell as it is made of plastic, but seems to be sturdy.","Satisfied.

1,Excellent Album From A New Artist!,"1. ""Sorry So Sorry""- A great first single, however, some time is needed to get used to it if you are new to his style, 8/102. ""She Says""- A ballad with emotional lyrics, definitely a favorite of mine 10/103. ""Secret""- I love the lyrics in this tune! 9/104. ""Slow Down""- Another favorite of mine, no doubt about it, 10/105. ""Ghost""- The video is as equally haunting as the tune! 10/106. ""Kristina""- I started off not liking this song, but it grew on me, and now I can say that it is one of my favorites 9/107. ""Everything Else""- A great song, but some people may need some time to get used to it. 9/108. ""More You Understand""- Another song with great lyrics 8/109. ""Morning After""- 7/1010. ""Disco""- my favorite song off of this album, with its haunting melody and lyricism, this song could easily stay on ""repeat"" for hours! 10/10","Excellent Album From A New Artist!. 1.

1,Great!,"I just love this jump rope. It has a nice fluid motion with the ball bearings! I ordered the 9.5ft rope and I am about 5'8"". It was just a little too long, so I looped each end and tied a knot about 4"" below each handle. This does not interfere with anything and shortens it just a bit. It is now the perfect length.","Great!. I just love this jump rope. It has a nice fluid motion with the ball bearings! I ordered the 9.5ft rope and I am about 5'8"".

0,Disapointed with Sound Quality,In my opinion the D'Addario EJ26 is very poor sounding set of acoustic strings. These are nowhere near as bright as DR strings and the snap was gone after one day of use. I went into a small shop that I became aware of close to home and they didn't have DRs so on the salesman's recommendation I tried D'Addario. This will be the last time.

1,"what's wrong with people, this movie rocked!","Seriously people are becoming quite picky with movies nowadays. This remake of the original wicker man stars Nicolas cage as a police officer looking for a missing child in a town called summersile. In this mysterious town everyone is acting strange as if they are involved in the child's kidnap. anyway i don't want to ruin anything else but I got to admit this movie was quite good. not better than the original but quite effective. And not to mention the awesome twist ending. The only thing i disliked was the theatrical cut, which removed a lot of important scenes. And the theatrical has a different ending which kind of kills the movie. So make sure to watch the unrated version instead.

0,Not so good...,"I am a big fan of some of Revell's other work, and I usually enjoy the comic/superhero scores, so I paid close attention to the music while watching the movie.

1,Second Pan - 10 years later,I bought this pan 10 years ago. After 10 years it's starting to wear out. That's some pan. I used to buy cheap non-stick pans that wore out after around a year. Time for a new pan. I'll easily buy this one again. I see that some reviewers had some bad experiences. Just take care of it. Use a sponge or a nylon scrubber to clean it. Keep it out of the dishwasher. Air dry. Done. Ten years. Sold...again.,Second Pan - 10 years later. I bought this pan 10 years ago. After 10 years it's starting to wear out. That's some pan.

0,Unappealing,"To be honest, this voice sounds like a voice major's junior recital--and by that I don't mean the voice sounds fresh. It's incredibly limited in range and almost always harsh on the top. Frankly I'd rather hear Schubert sung by just about anyone else. For these songs skip this one and try Elly Ameling. DeGaetani's pianos and pianissimos are nice but it is hard to understand how she had a career with the instrument she possessed.","Unappealing.

0,What SAP BW version ???,"Nowhere in the book, nor on Amazon detailed info nor in the ""view pages inside"" is mentioned that the book treats BW 2.0 and IS NOT GOOD for BW 3.1 or later.I had to read all the buyers reviews and to find out about the BW version, only after I had the book ordered and sent to me. So Because I use 3.2 I have sent back this book. It's not up-to-date, there seems not to be a reprint for BW 3.0So it was not useful to me. I am very disappointed.The book can show you some tasks to do in BW 2.0 but it learns you nothing if you have other cubes to make in different SAP applications.Also, it does not mention the transaction names behind the screens printed. Pitty, since this could have helped us when working in BW 3.0 (screens and menus can change but often the TX's remain the same)...","What SAP BW version ???.

1,"Unexpected, Interesting","When I ordered this, I had already ordered another art packet and was sorely dissapointed with it. When I got Busy Teacher's Guide: Art Lessons, it was not what I was expecting either. It does cover many areas of fine art introduction such as color, shading, contrast, mixing color, etc. This is to be used in homeschool for a 5th grader. While I think the explinations and history are over her head or at the least, even boring for her, I think the actual art, sometimes ""crafty"" projects might be fun for her.","Unexpected, Interesting.

0,Disappointed,"I enjoyed the music but the story completely misrepresented the Christian faith and at times made fun of it. The one person who realized that their singing should have been for the glory of God was portrayed as up-tight and hard nosed. She was converted in the end and joined the others for the win. The teenage daughter was encouraged to not be a ""Church girl"" and disobey her mom and do what she felt like. The movie sent a very poor message. Even if your not a Christian you can at least respect the choices of those who are.","Disappointed.

1,wow,"This is only the second Ian McEwan book that I have read but it certainly won't be the last!!From the mesmerising first chapter, where I was literally breathless, until the very satisfying and surprising conclusion I could think of little else. My mind was constantly thinking of possibilities that could have caused the dilemmas experienced by the extremely lifelike characters. McEwan has a way of drawing the reader in to become a silent bystander as the story unfolds. His descriptions are so realistic that at times I would re-read his phrases just for sheer enjoyment. This is a book to be savoured..not a fast read but highly recommended.","wow.

1,A voice that touches the heart,"After hearing this recording, I simply cannot understand the perception, shared even by Gerald Moore, that McCormack was less than comfortable in Grand Opera. Was he then merely a brilliant purveyor of popular Irish songs and ballads? On the evidence here, a profound 'NO'. In any medium, McCormack's voice and artistry strike at the heart with such a keenly spiritual richness. An Irish Gigli? Yes. He is to voice what Kreisler is to violin. It is an unforgettable experience to hear him here, and most especially in the deep night when all is still and the heart knows no boundaries of either time or space but only its own special yearning. I am so glad I bought this.","A voice that touches the heart.

It is an unforgettable experience to hear him here, and most especially in the deep night when all is still and the heart knows no boundaries of either time or space but only its own special yearning. I am so glad I bought this."
0,Published for eagles,"You have all heard the expression ""read the fine print"". This whole book is fine print. If your visual acuity is not comparable to that of our feathered friends or rated at 20/10 or better you will need two assistants. One to hold the magnifying glass and another to hold the tightly bound book open. It would be fine for regular reading but NOT sheet music!!! I would have gladly paid the extra bucks to have the material printed in a reasonably sized format such as 8 x ll with a spiral binding. I would give it NO stars and three black holes in this regard. It got 2 stars because the selections and arrangements are good. ...","Published for eagles. You have all heard the expression ""read the fine print"". This whole book is fine print.

1,Absolutely sublime,"This is quite possibly Lucinda Williams finest recorded work to date. I have no option but to award five well deserved stars. The songs and production are certainly not as immediately impressive as Car Wheels or World Without Tears. However, what we have is a superbly crafted and subtly understated work that rewards repeated listening through masterful and poetic use of lyrics, heatbreaking vocal expression, and near-perfect arrangements. It is wonderfully successful on all levels. There are no weak tracks, and I invariably listen to all 11 without skipping. The title track is a favourite; one of the sexiest things I've ever heard.","Absolutely sublime. This is quite possibly Lucinda Williams finest recorded work to date.

1,Alright,"This game's graphics are awesome. They're some of the best I have seen. But the ""con"" too that is the system requirments to run it, I have a P3 650 MHZ with a Voodoo 3 2000 PCI and 128 SDRAM even with that I could only run at medium graphics. The story line is alright, revenge and vengence is good enough for me. The controls are easy to remember to that makes the game easier to learn. Overall I give it 4 stars due to the system requirments.","Alright. This game's graphics are awesome. They're some of the best I have seen.

His voice hasn't quite matured yet, and he just sounds like the little kid he is, so he should stick to more kiddie songs than songs about girls.","Who let this kid out?!. Geez!

0,This movie has no substance.,"I have to say... all the CGI movies I have watched have all been top-notch as far as story goes. I'm talking about Toy Story I & II. Finding Nemo. Shrek. etc. etc. I realize this wasn't made by the same company as Toy Story and Nemo... but it IS from the creators of Shrek. Therefore this movie fails. The animation is good, yes. But the jokes are empty. Nothing is really funny at all. The story is almost non-existant and had no real direction.In my opinion, this movie was a waste of space. In everyway possible. Shame on you, Dreamworks. Shame on you.","This movie has no substance.. I have to say... all the CGI movies I have watched have all been top-notch as far as story goes.

If you are expecting to use this to record vocals, caveat emptor.However, I've had better luck using this as a guitar preamp after removing the chinese 12AX7 tube and replacing it with a Grooves Tubes Gold. It is running into a cheap solid state practice amp and has vastly improved the sound. Crank both the knobs and you will get a nice tube saturation, albeit with a noticeable hum. For $30, this really improved the sound of my mediocre guitar amp.In short, change the tube and you might find some nice guitar tones.","HUMMMMMMMMMM - UPDATE!.

0,"Never, Never, Never Shoulda Bought It!","Only two members of the original quartet--Terry Ellis and Cindy Herron--remain on this lackluster release by the Oakland hip-hop vocal group En Vogue. The group is now a trio, with the surviving original members joined by Rhonda Bennett. While their first releases, in the 90s, were joyous and sassy, ""Soul Flower"" lacks the immediacy and power of that early work. It would perhaps be unfair to catagorize this record as flat-out bad (truly, it's not), but it is the first En Vogue album that I find somewhat forgettable. New fans should begin instead with the girls' stronger efforts, such asFunky Divas, which is still their all-time classic. Also highly recommended areBorn to Sing, andMasterpiece Theatre, the latter setting hip-hop arrangements and lyrics to instantly-recognizable melodies from classical music. All of these albums are FUN--which is precisely what ""Soul Flower"" tries to be, but isn't.","Never, Never, Never Shoulda Bought It!.

1,Solid,"While it was not my favorite music biopic, it certainly was interesting. While I have liked Cash's music, I never knew that much about his life. At first I was not sure of Phoenix in the role, but when he began to sing he became Cash. The voice is dead on, as well as the movement and speach patterns. Reese also does a commendable job in singing all of her own songs as well. The movie ends 35 years before his death, so it doesn't cover the later part of his life. That's okay though, since Cash lived enough in his early years to fill 3 lifetimes.","Solid. While it was not my favorite music biopic, it certainly was interesting.

1,My dream mixer. Not so much now...an update.,"I purchased this for $34.99. Love it. Love the black. Even came with extra attachments.Well, it was fabulous for the year and 1 day it worked. Of course the warrenty ran out after a year so I was out of luck. Tried to have it fixed at their service center, but was told it wasn't repairable. Not a complete tradgedy since I got such a great deal on it, but would be upset if I'd paid full price. Purchased a Cuisinart this time because of the 3 year warrenty.","My dream mixer.

1,Nice quality aircap set.,"I have had this capset for about a year now and this it works great. I use it for shading lacquer and spraying water based lacquer. The fuji guns took me a little while to get familiar with, (the spring plate and aircap can be a pain sometimes) but once everything is put together the guns sprays great. I turn the air cap counter-clockwise one click to make a smaller fan when shading and this works great to satnd back and fog on color. One thing I noticed is that whe I change needle and aircap sets I have to also tighten or loosen the spindle valve seal nut, this is to allow the needle to slide more freely though the head of the gun. I recommend this unit to anyone intersted in purchasing an HVLP system.","Nice quality aircap set.. I have had this capset for about a year now and this it works great.

1,Had it over a year and it's still GREAT,"We use this at the beach, in the Gulf of Mexico. My daughters LOVE to get in this little boat and fight the waves ~ where we live, there is a ""shelf"" that keeps the depth of the water at about 3 feet for maybe 200-300 yards. I've had up to six little (13, 14, 15 & 16 year old's) flopping in and playing rough in this little boat. Ideally it's for 2 passengers and then it's very comfortable. Three, still not a problem. I don't recommend more than that, but as I stated, the boat has held up. The paddles are great and come with the boat. It's too much boat to blow up, but an air pump makes short and easy work of that.If you're going to use this in saltwater, I highly recommend washing it after each use and not storing on the sand when not in use. It works equally great in the rivers.","Had it over a year and it's still GREAT. We use this at the beach, in the Gulf of Mexico.

It's one I own and couldn't find the history on until I read this book. This is an excellent reference book.","As a Reference for Pocketwatches.

1,Don't know what I would do without it!!!,MY sonwas born 4 weeks premature and has bad acid reflux. He can't lay flat for a half hour after he eats and he throws up a lot when he lays flat. We tried a regular swing but he did not like the back and forth motion. We put him in this swing using the cradle swing part and he loved it. He sleeps so much better then before. I also think this swing is great for little one's because it is well padded and his head doesn't fall to the side when he falls asleep in it.Without this swing I would never get any sleep nor would my son.,Don't know what I would do without it!!!.

1,Imagination has no bounds....,"This new cupcake book by Gail Wagman shows that one is only bound by the limits of their imagination when it comes to creating recipes for a specific area of baking, in this case - cupcakes. Wagman's use of themes, design, color and artistic concepts are unlike anything I've seen. I love cookbooks and am aware that cupcakes are all the rage currently and the market is flooded with books on this subject. I look at all of them and haven't seen anything that can compare with her exquisite presentation, unique ideas, clear descriptions and easy to follow recipes. And the photographs do it all justice. This book should become the gold standard in this area and should be owned by all cooks and pastry chefs whether professionals or beginners.","Imagination has no bounds.....

1,"Fun, but not very well built","I bought this item after having mastered both the original Rubik's cube and the 4x4 Rubik's Revenge cube. Upon taking it out of the box, I noticed that it was very difficult to turn, and sometimes one of the edge pieces would protrude out after a turn. Also, anyone who knows how to solve the 4x4 cube can solve this cube with ease. The exact same algorithms are used, it just takes a little more finesse to get the center pieces sorted out. Overall this 5x5 cube isn't bad - I haven't had any problems with the stickers yet, and I've scrambled and solved it about a dozen times now.","Fun, but not very well built.

1,"Interesting, thoughtful work",I found this book to be an interesting read. A lot of great points are brought up in terms of meetings and how we use them in real life. The presentation via way of fable was enjoyable and made for a quick read (it took me roughly 2 evenings to get through this).My one concern is that to me there wasn't a lot of time expended on how best to apply these meetings in different settings. I can see the different meetings outlined working exceptionally well for an executive C-suite team (much like the fable part detailed) but I am working on adapting the philosophy to front-line positions to drive up my internal communication. It's taking some tweaking but I think I am getting to a place where I can use these guidelines to help my staff understand more of what is going on around them.,"Interesting, thoughtful work.

0,Brush came off in my player!,"Seems like a decent enough product, but on the very first use, one of the brushes fell off of the bottom of the lens cleaner while inside my car CD player, so now I've got a lens cleaner with one brush instead of two, and a fuzzy little brush part somewhere in the innards of my CD player. So far it hasn't done any harm, but the quality control appears to be lax.","Brush came off in my player!.

Not only was I able to save a lot of money but, for a small amount more, was able to finally get a car charger for my phone.

1,A very funny book.,I think this is a great book to read. I enjoyed it a lot. Kids should read this book because it is funny when Matilda uses her powers. It is about a little girl who wants to go to school but her father won't let her. So she plays jokes on him with her powers until he finally lets her go to school.,A very funny book..

0,"Looks nice, not sturdy","This case is actually quite well designed, it fits the phone snuggly, and is comfortable to wear on the belt - until - the locking mechanism breaks, which took only about one week of daily use. The problem seems to be the rather flimsy plastic pin contraption that locks the case into the belt clip. Once this 2 cent pin breaks, which happened easily and without any abuse, the case is actually worse than useless, because now your new $ 300 phone can simply fall off the belt.My recommendation: Don't buy it now - wait for Samsung to fix this flaw. In the meantime,consider other, third party, cases, but check the beltclip design!Summary: Nice design, badly executed. Disappointing product from one of the leading cellphone manufacturers.","Looks nice, not sturdy.

1,excellent bargain,"This pot rack is surprisingly sturdy and substantial, given the low price. I looked at some higher priced units that were not as well made nor as attractive and I'm glad I took another reviewer's advice to get it in chrome. Assembly was a snap and it took about an hour from start to finish to get it up on the wall. It holds three pans and five pots easily. I highly recommend this great bargain. After a year or so of use the rack looks like new and serves my purposes well.","excellent bargain. This pot rack is surprisingly sturdy and substantial, given the low price.

It has a very low center of gravity which makes it very safe for turns at higher speeds than we as parents feel comfortable with.

The box came equipped with five booster packs, three of which were for other expansion packs of Harry Potter. One Starter set, and four seven packs of movie cards which cannot be played with. When I played it it was so boring. The object of the game is to make your opponent discard all of his or her cards. Other reviews you may read about this item say you can cast fun spells and summon creatures to duel in battle, but when you really start to get into playing you'll see its just a matter of discarding cards.

1,Guild Wars: EotN Review,"A nice addition to the three primary campaigns. New models for new enemies (rather than just re-skinning old ones), good new skills, new titles to go chasing after if you're into that sort of thing.Overall it's a new playground for your characters, though expect the critters to be of stiffer stuff than most other areas. It also uses the previous overall continent for Tyria, which was nice since after playing through Prophecies I wanted to go explore the rest of the continent but couldn't. Significantly more in Tyria now. And there are fairly large underground areas, too, the new ""dungeons"" addition to the game. A good idea.The story stuck at about the level the primary campaigns did, so don't expect something terribly enthralling. Evil critter type X comes to destroy us all! Defeat the evil critters! The end.The only major disappointment I had about EotN was no new elite skills. They really could have added in a few for each of the classes. Oh well.Good game overall. 4/5.","Guild Wars: EotN Review. A nice addition to the three primary campaigns.

1,Why did I wait so long?,"I love my Kindle and now I am wondering why I waited so long to purchase it. I read quite a bit and I am finding that the local library just doesn't have the books I want when I want to read them. I have spent a great deal of money purchasing books and realized that I would save money by purchasing a Kindle. I love being able to download the books I want to read when I want them. It is the perfect size to keep in my purse, so now when I am waiting somewhere I don't have to read two year old magazines that I have no interest in, I just pull out my Kindle and enjoy reading what I am interested in. There is not one thing that I don't like about my Kindle.","Why did I wait so long?. I love my Kindle and now I am wondering why I waited so long to purchase it.

1,Bloodrayne....not so bad.,"Did this film have flaws? YES, BIG TIME. Beyond that, was this film entertaining? YES, ALOT. To me, Bloodrayne is like an extended episode of Buffy, but, with more action, blood/gore, and sex on a slightly bigger budget. I enjoyed every minute of it, though, I didn't like Uwe Boll's previous films.","Bloodrayne....not so bad.. Did this film have flaws? YES, BIG TIME. Beyond that, was this film entertaining?

1,For the Record,"Long-times fans know that Schooner Fare spent the first 10 of their 26 years together singing in Irish pubs in Halifax,Portland, Boston, NYC, Wash. D.C., Chicago, and Milwaukee.

Steve Romanoff's songs on SF's other albums have been recorded by Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy, Barleycorn, Foster & Allen, and many other Irish musicians..... making them ""Irish songs.""

0,The horror! The horror....,"I think watching this movie actually lowered my I.Q. I'm a fan of really bad movies. I actually own ""Boxing Helena"" and ""Sliver,"" so you can see that my tastes tend towards the corny... But this movie was soooo bad that not even I could find anything of redemptive value in it. It seems to have been written by ninth-grade boys who were high at the time. The special effects also seem to have had about a comparable budget. I only made it through the first hour of this movie, mainly because I was too paralyzed by the sheer awfulness of it to get my frozen finger to press the ""off"" button. If I were Jude Law, I would make it my life's quest to hunt down every copy and burn it.","The horror! The horror..... I think watching this movie actually lowered my I.Q.

0,Biggest disappointment yet!,"I was very excited when I found this deck.. The few card images displayed were quite beautiful. However, when I received it and started flipping through the cards I ended up very, very disappointed. First and mostly, I cannot figure out what the muscle men are all about. Ugly and distracting, not at all fitting.. don't get it! The courts, all the same exact picture/image, only difference in any suit is the color of the outfit the person is wearing. I misunderstood and thought the people were the same through out, NOT the actual scene. How boring and unimaginative! Also, mine have the black borders which I think take away from the artwork. Over all, the worst deck I own.. don't think I will ever use it. Thought about re-selling but would be ashamed of myself.

1,"Inspiring as usual, but not much of anything new.","Art is such a great songwriter! He has vision for exactly what he wants on record, and starting with Sparkle and Fade you could hear the passion and energy in the band, that's something a lot of bands lose. At some point, someone runs out of energy, and even with the good music and good lryics, often you can tell a band has hit a point where they just aren't into what they are doing anymore (Metallica anyone?). Everclear still has all the energy and passion, and although Slow Motion Daydream (collectively) isn't the best they've done, the spark is still there and it's inspiring.If you must draw a comparison to some of their past albums, this one can best be described as a mix of World of Noise and Songs From An American Movie Part II, it's heavier than most of them, still some of the best Punk this year.","Inspiring as usual, but not much of anything new..

1,Outstanding,"It tells the sad history of Communism. However, I expected something of a right wing diatribe against Communism. I was impressed that there was no omission for the driving forces behind Communism. The book acurately points to poverty in places like rural Cuba, Peru, and Nicaragua. It also points to the corruption and heartless indifference of preceding regimes. It's critical of Somoza, et al. Hence, it is clearly a book with an opposition to naked oppression.Like another commentator, I would have liked to hear about some of the movements where Communism failed to come to power; Brazil for example. Nevertheless, it is an excellent read, and long overdue.","Outstanding. It tells the sad history of Communism. However, I expected something of a right wing diatribe against Communism.

They're pretty good though, very realistic whip damage, one of the best ever.There's some other minor nudity (the undressing scene at the start of course), and I might give it one more star if it wasn't for the absolutely gutless cop out of showing zero actual whipping scenes in a movie titled like this.

I also thought this La Crosse would be larger by the picture shown. It is harder to read than our older La Crosse ones because of its size. Our old one was wall hanging and this one is made for a mantle or table. Just an adjustment we can live with. We hope others will find this to be a very dependable product as we have in past years.","La Crosse WS-7014CH-IT Wireless Weather Station.

0,Surprising Disappointment,"Being both a Beegie Adair and a Cole Porter fan I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this CD, but would have to say it is, to my taste, the weakest of her works. I've tried to think why, and believe it is a conflict between a great instrumentalist and a great lyricist, indeed poet. Porter's genius was in his poetry, set to catchy tunes.In this CD, Beegie seems to run rampant with the music to the point that one can't follow the lyrics, either in your head or aloud. It seems a bit egotistical to me to do so, and I would compare this CD with her wonderful ""I'll Take Romance,: where Beegie seems to worship the songs she plays. In ""Dream Dancing,"" it's more of a battle.The final track ""Begin the Beguine"" is just painful, a slow funeral dirge of a song that can be a great self proclamation.Not recommended.","Surprising Disappointment.

1,Warts and all.,"This is a highly critical biography of an American icon. It is well researched and ably presented, and above all, strips away the layers of goo which tend to surround any quasi-immortal national image of no matter which country. Many Americans will be surprised and shocked by revelations about, for example, the callousness with which he and his fellow planters bought, sold and even bequeathed their slaves. He emerges as no particularly great general or statesman, but simply as the best available at the time. It is the kind of dissection to which many more folk-heroes might well be subjected, and one which the British tend to do to their heroes more than most. It is agreeable to find an American author undertaking the same sort of debunking and is a book unlikely to leave the knowledgeable reader undisturbed. Glad to hae found it on Aamazon's web-site.","Warts and all.. This is a highly critical biography of an American icon.

1,Kao the Kangaroo is a neat and funny game,"Kao the kangaroo is a really neat game, but it has good and bad points. the bad things are that the levels are WAY to short. it only usuallly takes a few minutes to get past one, until you get into world 3. there are 25 levels and eventually, they get hard. a big problem is the third boss, Zeus. there's a really bad strategy to beat him. you will work forever on that unless you search the web for the answer. It's funny because there are little eskimos chasing you and snowmen whacking you, etc. ... Some good things are that you get to ride space scooters, ride snowboards, ride a boat, use a hang glider, and play with other fun vehicles. I give this game a 97% for very fun gameplay, cool use of vehicles, and cute graphics, but way too short levels.","Kao the Kangaroo is a neat and funny game.

It's rather unfortunate since the Dark Queen is supposed to be the ultimate villain in Dragonlance. Not terrible... just not good. Average at best.","Just Average..

0,ALL ABOUT ROLLERCOASTERS,"I was expecting to buy a DVD on the different parks at Disney and get a sense of what Disney is all about. I got this DVD for my mother-in-law to give her as prelude of what's to come as I got her tickets to Disney for Christmas. I wanted her to see how much fun Disney can be. What the different parks offer. The parades. The firework display at the end of the night. All of that. Unfortunately, even though this DVD was nicely done and informative, it was all about rollercoasters and nothing but rollercoasters. My 70 year old mother-in-law doesn't want to ride a rollercoaster.

1,Fascinating Contemporary Portrait of a Megacity,"While Venezuela's leader, Hugo Chavez, is frequently in the news, little is reported about life in the capital city of Caracas. This visual diary and commentary provides a fascinating contemporary portrait of the living conditions in Caracas. While squatter settlements, known as ""barrios"" in Venezuela, have been around for decades, the extent to which the formal, planned urban areas in Caracas have been surrounded and overtaken by the informal city is astonishing. In the 60's there were many ambitious plans to develop and redevelop major parts of the city, but these have, on the evidence presented here, not materialized. Instead, people have continued to migrate from the rural areas, drawn by the allure of the big city and the possibilities for a better life. Breathtaking.","Fascinating Contemporary Portrait of a Megacity. While Venezuela's leader, Hugo Chavez, is frequently in the news, little is reported about life in the capital city of Caracas.

That said, John Howard Yoder's contribution, Practicing the Rule of Christ, is worth more than its weight in gold.

This article was, without any doubt, the most provocative thing I've read in quite some time.

While this certainly doesn't generate any heat, it is fun and looks great at night on the big screen.Audio options are very nice, too.

1,Camera Filter,"My husband bought a new camcorder from Sony a couple months back. He looked up the filters and extra batteries in Sony. They were much more expensive than on Amazon. I looked them up on Amazon and told him the price difference and we decided to order from Amazon. It was an excellent decision as they fit the camera perfectly and work very well. I am sure he will want other supplies and I will gladly check Amazon before he buys elsewhere. Besides, Shipping is also faster than Sony!","Camera Filter.

1,A great read!,"I am very careful about what I choose to read. I have a busy career and want to spend my home time relaxing. This book was a melody of feelings and scenes from all of our youths. The main character experiences sadness and joy and a love that he must keep private. The scenes from his home are sensitive and warm. There are many clever lines and turns in this work. The sub-plots were cleverly interwoven . As an English teacher, I constantly looked for good Canadian writers- Henaut makes the grade.","A great read!. I am very careful about what I choose to read.

1,A must have for any history buff of human space travel,"This story (really a history) has been worth every cent I paid for it. I have been a real fan of human space flight (and NASA in general). This series shows many peoples points of view of the Apollo program, astronauts to the contractors that built the machine. Like the movie Apollo 13, there is more than one angle. I have watched it many times, and never get bored with it. I am pleased to have it as one of my early DVD titles. I am 42, and it (to use the early 70's word, FREAKS me out) to think about the youth of today who only read about this stuff in history books. I lived it on TV as a teenager. I have never looked at the moon the same since. I see it and remember the years that humans walked there. It is now a place humans have visited. This series describes just how much work from so many different people it took to get there. I will watch it until the disk wears out.","A must have for any history buff of human space travel.

Its designed to read ""UP THE PAGE"" divided into two different sections driving North or South. which is not normal and is confusing. The center part is the only good part. It reads like a history lesson that makes good reading. (2 stars) I will take it with me for bedtime reading. Too bad the edition outdated.","Where's Florida.

0,A typical vanity picture,"It's been the rare music superstar who doesn't turn their hand to at least one movie, and Neil Diamond is no exception. ""The Jazz Singer"" is not a good film, either cinematically (Sir Laurence Olivier stated flat out that he did this one for the money) or musically (""Hello Again"" is pretty, but much of the rest of the soundtrack tries WAY too hard). Diamond has a deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression for much of the movie, except when he's singing. Olivier's over-the-top performance is a treat for cheese lovers, though, and Lucie Arnaz actually does a pretty good job. Overall, though, if you're not a Neil Diamond fan (and even if you are), this film is pretty tough going.","A typical vanity picture.

1,"Oh, this is just lovely.","This band kind of reminds me of a baby Collide - a younger and more underground version of that band's gothic and industrial fusion with powerful female vocals and a strong sense of spirituality and mysticism. What makes Ego Likeness stand out is the earnestness of their lyrics and delivery, and the Southern-tinged storytelling theme of the album. While they can be a bit overwrought at times, this music is beautiful, energising, and worth playing in many different settings. I greatly look forward to their next album. My favourite tracks include the title cut, ""Mandala"", ""Hurricane"", and ""Wolves"".","Oh, this is just lovely..

0,EASILY THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"Everyone seems to think that Maya Angelou is a great author. In my opinion, there has never been a worse book written. Even the style of writing put me to sleep. If I were reading a good story, written in her style, I wouldn't enjoy it. Usually I only use these reviews to say how good many books are, but I felt that this one was bad enough to warrant warning the world about what an awful piece of literature it is.","EASILY THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.

1,"Nice, but ""organized""","At the time, this was just a fun book; now it's a fun remember-when book from before the tech bust.The only thing that I dislike about the book is that it's been ""organized"" by theme -- whether or not that means breaking up a story arc. It's rather disruptive, especially since the drawing style changed quite a lot (and generally for the better) in the early days. So you're cheerfully reading through a story, and BAM! You're back to scribbles and your story arc is nowhere to be seen.If Peter Zale ever resurrects the strip, I hope that he'll consider a more chronological approach to future books.","Nice, but ""organized"".

1,Tennessee Williams -- In his own words...,"I became interested in Tennessee Williams after reading the book ""Tom,"" which is a biography of Tennessee's life. So after reading ""Tom,"" I ordered ""The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams, Vol 2"" from Amazon and began reading it as soon as it arrived. I chose to order volume 2 before volume 1 because it contains letters to and from Tennessee during some of the most productive years of his career. It is interesting to read, in his own words, how he handled and felt about these successes.In anticipation of the Tennessee Williams Festival in New Orleans this month, I suppose it is time to move on to volume 1.

0,Complete pile of junk,"This product is inferior to say the least. I thought since it was a Cuisinart it would be a good product.

I figured since the original list price on it was $180, it would be high quality. STAY AWAY! This blender is worse than my $15 Walmart special.

It's better if you have it with a full glass of water, although there's a very strong aftertaste. My husband took a bite and spit it out -- the same with my six year old. My two-year-old son, however, seemed to actually like it and will eat a bar as a snack if I broke it up into small pieces. I just couldn't get past the taste. I still have over a box left, which I'll dole out to my son as snacks, but it's defiantly not something I would ever buy or recommend. In fact, if someone told me they were going to buy them, I'd ask if they'd ever eaten them before and if not, I would tell them pick a different product.

1,Pretty Good but...,This is a pretty good spring pistol. It's got good weight to it and is made of quality plastic that can handle a lot of use. It also looks very realistic and has a functioning slide lock which is a nice touch. A few problems that kept me from giving it 5 stars were that the safety mechanism is a little loose and can catch the trigger if the gun isn't perfectly upright. The same is true of the slide lock. If you don't hold the gun upright when you cock it the slide lock has a tendency to engage. Once you get used to it the slide action is very good though.,Pretty Good but....

Also, they say Mac compatible, but what they really mean is that it won't break if you plug it into your Mac. The software it comes with is definitely not compatible, but you can drag and drop from iTunes. Hope this helps!"
1,Great Scissors,"Being able to control scissors is great, being left handed and using ""regular"" scissors cutting something and not being able to follow the lines was hard. Picking up ""regular"" scissors and putting your thumb in the wrong side was always a problem, especially in smaller scissors. With these scissors I have better control of where I want to cut, and the positions of the finger and thumb holes are perfect.","Great Scissors.

0,Coating Peeled Off,"As several other reviewers mentioned, the unit directions are misleading and confusing. I did figure out how to get it it work and made a stew so delicious, my father compared it to his mother's (the highest compliment you can get in this family). However when I went to clean the unit, I noticed the non-stick surface was bubbling and peeling right off. Awesome - just gave my family cancer with their holiday meal. I am very careful with my appliances and only used wooden utensils and cleaned it with a soapy washcloth, nothing scouring. I am very disappointed and will be returning this ASAP.","Coating Peeled Off. As several other reviewers mentioned, the unit directions are misleading and confusing.

0,The Fairy Tale is Over Success Was Not Achieved Here,"Retelling fairy tales we all grew up with is a sensational idea which has been done extremely well. Just not here!

These are some of the most boring low quality stories ever written. Also avoid the books A Wolf at the Door and Snow White Blood Red edited by Ellen Datlow as they are no better than this.If you do want really good retelling of classic tales rewritten in sensational format buy Once Upon A Crime or Politically Correct Fairy Tales.

1,A must read!,"Speak is truly a book that will stay with you. I have read it multiple times and was thrilled when the 10th anniversary edition came out. When I first read this book in high school, it scared me. I was only 15 and couldn't imagine living like that. I still can't relate to the aftermath of sexual assault, but I can relate to finding my voice and standing up for myself. Having just read Speak again recently, almost eight years later, I feel empowered. It is not a story of tragedy but a story of hope. It starts out very dark but as time goes on, we get to see Melinda come back to herself and face down her demons. It's very moving and very powerful. I highly recommend it to teens and adults alike, as we can all learn something from Melinda's story.","A must read!. Speak is truly a book that will stay with you.

The usual ""beat your children with a rod"" stuff is in this little pamphlet, as if we needed more reminding of Old Testament brutality like whippings and stonings.

I suggest you pass on this book, and read some good non-violent parenting books by Sears, Whitehurst, Granju, O'Mara, and La Leche League. It's worth remembering that Jesus never advocated hitting children. Christ shows us a new way to relate to each other, out of forgiveness and love. Reading the New Testament with open eyes and heart could help a lot of people get away from the idea that violence solves problems. Violence just begets violence.

1,Global Goon - Vatican Nitez,"While it's odd that ""IDM"" encompasses everything from drill `n' bass to glitch to this little gem of an album, Global Goon's third for Rephlex, the term ""braindance"" describes VATICAN NITEZ pretty well. The rhythms on this album are near danceable (though I don't necessarily suggest throwing one into your DJ set), but the main draw are the catchy melodies that drift through. ""Jerky Dharma,"" for example, has its quiet tones reprised by the louder tones and harmonized by the singing. But it's not until the later half of the album that the magic really starts to shine through: ""Drugula"" (my favorite) has a simple structure, but its melody catches the listener off-guard and pulls him willingly into the music. ""Scott Cronce is the CEO"" has a wobbly funk that's infectious as well. It might be off-kilter, but at times, it really hits the spot.","Global Goon - Vatican Nitez.

0,An attack on masculinity disguised as an attack on logic,"Although it may not be immediately evident, the real theme of this book is to discredit rational and logical thought processes by linking them with Hitler via Weininger and Wittgenstein. The idea is that masculinity is essentially evil and leads to all sorts of horrors such as rational and logical thinking, which somehow lead to the Holocaust. This discourse is part of a much larger one in which science is the ultimate bugaboo. This sort of thing goes at least as far back as the Romantics (""ye murder to dissect""), but in this case is mixed in with the idea that gay men and women are on the side of illogic and unreason, and are therefore the good guys in the war against linear thinking of any sort, which is seen as a product of male heterosexuality. In short, this book is nonsense.","An attack on masculinity disguised as an attack on logic.

A cross between Tim McGraw, Hal Ketchum, & Clint Black. He's great! Had the entire place rockin'. Traditional country, a little old soul music and coutry rock.

0,Terrible!,"I cannot recommend this product. I bought a few, excited to try my hand at sprouting.Well, today is the 3rd day, and the sprouts have been doing well! The alfalfa outgrew the clover and mung beans, so I decided to harvest some of it. Imagine my disgust when I unscrewed the lid and found that the screen had turned black along the edge! I wouldn't call it rust -- it's not red -- more like some less-friendly oxidation. (Nickel? Chromium?) And the black wasn't just some surface-finish, but a fine powder. I tried eating some of the sprouts, but couldn't, because they had a very strong metallic taste. Possibly poisonous, but definitely not wholesome. What a waste of my first batch of sprouts.I won't be deterred from this little hobby, but I'm going to pick up some of the plastic perforated lids instead.Notes: The edges are rough-cut, not finished or folded over. Also, if you do decide to ignore my recommendation and buy this product, it is designed to fit a widemouth jar.","Terrible!. I cannot recommend this product.

1,Well written and very enjoyable,"This book is historical Christian romantic fiction. The historical aspects of it were very interesting, taking place during the 17th century in colonial Virginia (which is ironically set very close to where I live- I did not know this when I purchased it). It includes many aspects of colonial life of which I was unaware. It is Christian fiction without being on a soapbox. Certain parts felt a bit rushed and at one point it seemed very anti-women's education as a theme. I don't know if that was the aim of the author- it seems unlikely as the author is a female. I suggest giving this book a try.Overall I rate it a solid 4 stars. =)","Well written and very enjoyable. This book is historical Christian romantic fiction.

0,Worked for one road trip... :(,"I was excited to get this positively rated radar detector for our upcoming roadtrip down to LA. It worked okay but had many false alarms.

Unfortunately when I tried for another long road trip a month later, I found out it had died. :( I didn't think things could just die spontaneously like that but to me it was not worth dealing with the company or buying another Whistler product again.","Worked for one road trip... :(.

Rather than dealing with the hassle of mailing keys or meeting up with guests to do a key swap and worry about getting them back, we simply installed The Master Lock 5401D in an easy to find, but out of the way spot at our beach house.

Save your $ on this 5th edition, if you have any other options, until Prentice-Hall corrects their quality control publishing problems (& until they ""step up to the plate"" & correct problems when they've goofed!)."
0,******DONT RENT NOR BUY THIS MOVIE*************,"this movie is so horrible to watch; its a torture. At first you are like ok this movie is just starting it will get better. Ok they cannot stay in this scene any longer. Like the other revier said, ""I do not know if I should keep watching it to see if it becomes better."" Trust me it did not get better. Its so boring and so lame. The ending is the worst part. It ends where it begins with another family.

1,Bee Gees Best!,"During a strenuous time for the brothers Gibb, they managed to make an instant classic. Strange arrangements and lyrics (thanks mainly to Robin)spun together with a solid cohesiveness of beautiful harmonies and great, mature songwriting. The Bee Gees were at their musical peak. The orchestral opener, about a ship lost at sea sets the tone where everything musical is possible. ""Marley Purt Drive"" could have been written by Robbie Robertson(but it wasn't). The odd rocking arrangement of ""Whisper Whisper"" must have been adopted by Elvis Costello for his ""Trust"" album. And ""Melody Fair"" is just....gorgeous. Arguably, the best Bee Gees song out there. Maybe Odessa's oddness turned many people off. This is an album that samples so many genres. So many artists have tried to record an album like this and have failed. Not the Bee Gees. This is truly an under appreciated but appealing album.","Bee Gees Best!.

1,Raises important questions,"The book raises questions I never thought to ask. The contrast between the aims of Jesus the practicing Jew, and Paul the religious promoter to the gentiles, is good to be reminded of. Since we know that Jesus of Nazareth and Christ of the Nicene creed are rather different characters, it would not surprise me if the actual Paul is different from how church tradition sees him. However, Maccoby is not an academic historian, and his assertions are sparsely footnoted. I have learned that professional historians are not accepting of some (or many?) of Maccoby's conclusions regarding specific issues such as, the witness of the Ebionites, and Paul's status as a Pharisee (or not). Still, the main point of the book rings convincing, and the book is valuable to raise questions for further study of the historical Paul and Christian origins, which the reader can pursue through books from more trained historians.","Raises important questions.

I don't mind the plastic construction at all since it ends up being very light-weight and it has been perfectly sturdy over the years. I find it amusing that the price of the lens has been steadily increasing over the years, but it's not surprising given its performance and quality. I have several primes of my own, but I hardly ever grab those other than for specific needs such as for wide angle or for telephoto. This lens will give you the L glass performance at a fraction of the price. Please see my hummingbird photos for examples.","My workhorse lens.

Man, don't promote sexual activity to young kids.I haven't read a wrestling autobiography since this disappointment. My advice is this, don't buy this book, don't buy Chyna's book, don't buy Lita's book. Buy Mick Foley's book if you must read about the life of a wrestler.","How much of this did the Rock actually write?. I enjoyed Mankind's book, so I bought this one. This one was quite different.

1,Good selection of poses,"I bought the VHS tape of Nude Yoga in 1999, and that was my first introduction to yoga. Since then I have started to take classes with yoga instructors, and I am very impressed with the selection of poses that were chosen for the video. It is true that the women in the video have not all mastered the poses, and it's just wrong for the one woman to have socks on. I'm also not real sure why the progam had to be nude. A one piece leotard would have sufficed, and the video doesn't seem like it's trying to be sexy, so what was the point of the nudity? ANyway, I have come to igonore the nudity and enjoy the poses. There is a very good selection of basic and difficult poses (except that there are no warrior poses), and the narrator explains the benefits from the poses. I really enjoy this program.","Good selection of poses. I bought the VHS tape of Nude Yoga in 1999, and that was my first introduction to yoga.

0,Training techniques of dogs so unbelievable book not of any value,"As a foster for dogs and lover of animals, I immediately questioned the training techniques in this book. Near the beginning the trainer/psychic said a female dog would only get better if she had a litter of puppies. I almost puked. In a world of over population of dogs and cats this is a very OLD belief system. Therefore everything else I read was unbelievable. Tens of thousands of healthy dogs and cats are put to sleep in America alone because of overpopulation and people not spaying or nuetering. While I stumbled through the book I kept finding more things that made the lead character unbelievable. I won't be buying anymore of the Isabel Wolff books.","Training techniques of dogs so unbelievable book not of any value.

1,A fun game about celebrities,"I wrote a review about this game in the other Marry Date or Dump section. Basically, there's three names on a card, like Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks and Tom Selleck. On your turn, depeding on the roll of the special die, you decide who you would marry date or dump, or who you would want for a doctor, lawyer or pool cleaning boy. Other choices are parent, sibling or cousin, and party with, live with and wrestle with. Other players try to guess your answers. They score one point for each one they get right. When it's your turn, you get two points for every person who voted for all your choices correctly.A fun game that's now out of print, but Amazon.com has it. It's from 2004, so most of the current big names are included here, including fictional characters, politicians and Biblical names. The box is divided into men and women, so gay or straight people can play this game. If you're bisexual, you can alternate between the two boxes.","A fun game about celebrities.

The actors I think tried to make do with what they had, but even their acting came out duller then a bad joke done by Michael Richards. As much as I hate saying it and writing it these actors may need to go back to acting school. I know its all about money in this world but really what were these producers thinking as they said, ""We are going to release this in the U.S. and its going to be huge?"" Yeah a huge waste of time, at least I didn't spend money actually watching this. A huge relief on that part.","Why? Why Was it Even Released In Theater?.

It's possible that some deep thinking English majors might like this approach but for me it was dull, difficult to read and monotonous.If you have read A Star Called Henry, I highly recommend you give this follow-up a miss so as not to spoil your impressions of the story.","A big disappointment after the brilliance of A Star Called.

All of the reviews I've read for this band have been quite positive, and there's a great reason.

Furthermore, Brandon and Ben did everything on the album themselves and that deserves some major props. Go out on a limb and check out a band you may not have considered before.

0,Expensive Junk,"This is the worst printer we have ever owned. We have owned many and at times printed hundreds of thousands of pages per year. The red on this printer became disfunctional after the first cartridge. Despite cleaning etc., it never revived. Oh, but it uses plenty of red toner, it just does not come out red on the page. The cartridges are outrageously expensive, and the last time I bought them, the brand new color ones came only half full. Not acceptable for an $80 cartridge. The thing is loud and cycles repeatedly to clean, calibrate or whatever. Then throw in the HP nonsense with their continuous updating and screwy driver jig for more fun.Throw on top of all that that HP now has some of the worst service in the industry, and you have an expensive piece of junk. I am tossing mine when the toner runs out the next time rather than spend over $300 for cartridges. Throwing $1000 in 20s off a bridge would have been a lot more fun.","Expensive Junk.

Then throw in the HP nonsense with their continuous updating and screwy driver jig for more fun.Throw on top of all that that HP now has some of the worst service in the industry, and you have an expensive piece of junk. I am tossing mine when the toner runs out the next time rather than spend over $300 for cartridges. Throwing $1000 in 20s off a bridge would have been a lot more fun."

1,Great fun!,"I first played this game with some friends on a camping trip. I was hooked immediately! Reminds me of playing gin rummy with my grandparents when I was little. I purchased this game a few weeks ago before traveling to see my in-laws. We all spent hours over the course of a few days playing this game. The attache version is a great choice... It travels easily and packs well. It doesn't take too much space, and there's a place for everything (timer, bag for chips, chip holders). It isn't exactly ""travel size"", but it depends on how much room you have and how small you can tolerate the pieces being. This is a good compromise. The numbers are easy to read and the colors (mostly) are very distinct. My only ""complaint"" (if you call it that) is that on a few pieces the orange color is very dark and almost looks like red. But with good lighting this isn't really a problem.","Great fun!. I first played this game with some friends on a camping trip. I was hooked immediately!

0,Atomic (?) Clock,"I have been using this unit for about ten months now. The clock runs well but I have already replaced the battery once. It seems that, if the clock is fast, periodically the clock has to pace through the 12 hours to reset. The other comments about this clock not adapting to the time change are absolutely true according to my experience also. In the fall, I had relatively little problem because I set the unit to Central time instead of Eastern until the unit finally corrected for the time change about a month later. Spring time change left me an hour off since the unit has no Atlantic setting. I did get them to send me a return number but, since it would cost me to send it back, I decided that it would not be worth my returning the clock...Caveat emptor!","Atomic (?) Clock.

1,An instant calm...,"I randomly borrowed a CD from a friend just to have something new to listen to, and was lucky enough to pick one by Michael Hedges. I know his work has gotten a lot of merit for its technical aspects and arrangements, but there is something more about this CD and his others. It has this hypnotic charm which always puts me at ease. I recommend this CD from the bottom of my heart to anyone. I heard that he has recently died, and I will mourn the loss of his music as much I would mourn the loss of a close and dear friend.","An instant calm....

Presented well, with excellent photos and TV footage. Also the interviews with Jimmy the Weasel, Joey Cantalupo and Ray Ferrito gives a rare insight of how the minds of these guys work. They discuss murder with such an air of innocence, it is frightening.My only disappoint is that the doco being made in 1984, ends in 1984. I would love to see another series of this calibre made detailing what happened from 1985 to the present day.For those who dislike videos in the day of the DVD, I was about to buy this set from Amazon, but I actually found it in Melbourne on DVD (2 discs, instead of seven tapes) and it was only $30 Australian.","Goodfellas/Godfather as a documentary.

0,A gathering of old men,"A Gathering of Old Men is a good book to read if you like reading an entire book on one single day. I found the book pretty boring. I feel you only need about three chapters to write about one day. The book was long and drawn out. The only thing that made it somewhat interesting was the descriptions of the people and using different narrators. It does a great job of giving reference to southern racism and problems with land, money, and people. The way the book is written you can't tell if the author is black or white, male or female in that sense it's a real good book but you have to have a lot of time and patience. You would also have to be a young adult or an adult to understand most of the meaning, words etc... It has a lot of profanity and other inappropriate stuff in it for young children. The content of the book is mostly rated PG 13 but it slips up to R every once and awhile. Other than that it was an ok book that I would only recommend to older people.","A gathering of old men.

0,Big mistake I wish I had read the reviews first,"We put this on our wedding registry and at the time it was $59.00. At that price I assumed it would work very well as it costed more than most hand vacs. I was wrong and I regret not reading the reviews. Shark should have recalled this product. The battery is faulty. I charged overnight then used it to vacuum my car and it faded after 2 minutes. I assumed it just needed more charging time so I charged it for 2 days straight, I brought it to my car to vacuum the seat and it died again in 2 min. We have never been able to use this product successfully. It will take me 2 weeks to vacuum the entire at this rate.","Big mistake I wish I had read the reviews first.

0,Why was this made?,"I read the book for this a few months ago. Even though it wasn't the greatest book, it did have a lot of good parts to it. Unfortunately, all of the best parts of the book were removed from the film, and replaced with mediocre parts, at best.In the book, there were Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, and a bit of magic. I the movie, there were no Elves, no Dwarves, the Dragon was a flying chicken (i.e. feathers, instead of scales), and the magic was lost.The acting in the movie was poor, and the plot was rather thin. You didn't get a chance to feel for any of the characters, since there was very little in character development.All in all, there isn't really anything that can be done to redeem this movie.","Why was this made?.

0,"Great for a month, then...","PROS:-Good looking watch.-Fairly easy to use.-Love the fact that the watch face is twisted to make viewing it while I run easier.-The watch's wrist band held up well, unlike the Swiss Army watches I've had crack on me.CONS:-After only a month's use, the plasic wrap that encases the watch itself started to detach and warp. It appears as though it was simply glued to the metal part of the watch. It's now so warped that it looks terrible and makes it difficult to press the buttons along the side.-At 18 months, the watch has bugun to collect moisture inside. From diving deeper than its 100M rating, you ask? No, from sweat and shower water. The digital display is now failing and I'll soon have to throw the watch away like a piece of trash. That's just unnaceptable, Nike.","Great for a month, then....

1,Not for the complete beginner,"Worked through this course, this past weekend. To be honest,I don't think this course is suitable for complete beginners. Although there is an introduction to the Piano Accordion, a large numer of assumptions are made, basic music reading and previous knowledge of keyboard. It is suitable for a player looking to pick up the instrument again (like myself) and encourages experimentation and improvisation.","Not for the complete beginner.

1,I've got my summer jams now!,"I first heard ""Tomorrow Comes Today"" a couple of months ago on the local college radio station. I was instantly hooked and found myself bobbing my head as I cruised through Uptown. Next I heard ""Clint Eastwood"" and ""Rock Tha House"". Both are phat tracks. After hearing those three songs, I knew that Gorillaz was gonna be the album of the summer. Thus, it was with much anticipation that I waited until the album was released. I just picked it up today and after listening to it a couple of times, I have to say its already my favorite album of the year. The mixture of cool beats and laid back melodies will put a smile on your face instantly. If you liked Handsome Boy Modeling School or Deltron 3030, check this album out.","I've got my summer jams now!.

This isn't a new concept, Zophar's Domain and other sites have save states and I'm sure there's probably SOME way to put them back onto a memory cart... but to me that's kinda boring though, not as fun as making ""flying"" and ""power attack"" codes.

1,Nearly Perfect,"I purchased this clip because all the clips I currently have that came with my headphones have broken. I was looking for something with a different design that might last at least as long as the headphones. As many have already mentioned. the hole in the clip is too big for most healphone cords. I easily solved that issue with a small piece of duct tape wrapped around the cord, between the clip and the headphones. I've been on a few 3-hour runs with the new clip and I've had no problems with it. Out of the box I'd rate it a 4 star product. With some tweaking - 5 stars.","Nearly Perfect.

Though I bought this set elsewhere, I bought other pieces from amazon with the 4-for-3 offer to complete the set. I cook twice everyday and I have to say, Ive loved cooking with these pots! The 8 qt stockpot that comes with the set is what I use very sparingly, given its size...making it slightly unuseable for my small family of 4. Otherwise I got the 3.5 qt casserole, 2 qt & 3 qt. saucepans. I also got a 6 qt stockpot and pretty much those cover all my cooking needs. Very heavy and will certainly last a lifetime. I havent cooked with All-clad yet, so I cant comment if this set is comparable, but All-clad is definitely in my list :)","Amazing set of cookware!.

But Dame Joan Sutherland is without question the undisputed greatest vocal interpreter of the masterpieces of Bellini, Donizetti, and Rossini.I challenge anyone to find any recording version of any aria in this complete cd collection that can even come close to Sutherland's super supendous performances here.God bless Dame Joan Sutherland, from E to shining (high)E!","God bless Dame Joan Sutherland from E to shining(high)E.

0,The last three minutes of the movie were COOL!! the rest was...,"BORING AND STUPID! The movie stars with some bad magic soldier guys that are killing people in a kung fu way. Then, no action until the middle of the film which you can see a war between humans and dragons in the city. Then, no action until the last three minutes that leads to the COOL one to one final battle of the two dragons.I thought that Dragon Wars was about a war between dragons, not humans! the only good stufs were the special effects that were AWESOME! Some human fights and the war in the city which was well edited. The rest was lame. Not to mention the bad acting.P.S: Don't let the cover fool you. Rent it before you buy it!adios.","The last three minutes of the movie were COOL!! the rest was.... BORING AND STUPID!

Spank The Monkey is overall an awesome rock band, but they are diversified at the same time. ""White Trash Lullabies"" is proof of that and of how well they can put it all together. This cd is a must have cd. ""Breathe"" deserves a rock award! It has been heard world-wide. ""One and Only One"", written for a child is heart clinching. I could go on and on about the vast greatness of this cd. Add it to your collection.","The CD Is Far From Trash. ""White Trash Lullabies"" is Spank The Monkey's 2nd cd.

1,HEALING that keeps giving...,"I bought my edition of Bradshaw's ""Healing the Shame that Binds You"" in 1988, one year after my experience with The Caron Foundation's ACOA treatment program.This book magnified in detail the specifics of my co-alcoholism.

0,Nice attempt but ...,"This movie started off really well. The introduction was solid. However, the movie fell apart along the way when you couldn't find the storyline. And you didn't share an interest in the two lovers. One character was remotely interesting and he was pretty good. The african american actor who was very good in the film. I admire the filmmakers enthusiasm and they did some very nice shots and setps but as a whole, it was empty and you didn't care or even remember the characters. And for the film ""to be continued"" was a little pretentious of them, assuming they would have a hit and garnered interest for a second film. Good shot, guys ... in places a lot of fun but fell short in the character and plotline","Nice attempt but .... This movie started off really well. The introduction was solid.

1,Very nice racket case,"This is a great little case and an even better value for the money. I have a Stiga Ultimate paddle and was simply looking for something inexpensive to protect it.

I carry a separate ball case made by Joola, which, surprisingly, was twice the price of this racket case. Ahh, marketing tactics . . .","Very nice racket case.

1,Best PC Magainze - just wish they'd make a kindle-only edition,"I've been a reader for over 4 years, and their magazine is simply the best PC magazine available. The only downside is that they use a service like coverleaf for their digital version, which is so behind the times they offer no Android app, and they offer no digital-only subscriptions. I'm no 'tree-hugger' but I prefer to cut down on paper and clutter, and cut down on the stuff I end up throwing in the trash. I have an Android tablet on which I read a lot of things now, and I'd love to be able to subscribe to Maximum PC in a digital-only version, but it appears that is not something that is available. For a magazine that is cutting-edge, you'd think they'd have it available. The lack of a digital-only subscription is the only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Content of the magazine and the website are both great, so they get HUGE points for that. If they had a digital only subscription I'd certainly give it 5-stars.","Best PC Magainze - just wish they'd make a kindle-only edition.

1,My Favorite Memory,"I still remember. I was in the 6th grade. I heard Semi Charmed Life and I just loved it. I brought the cassette and listened to it over and over and over. Then my dad took me to a music store and I brought the album. Then I brought a cassette player (I had a walkman) just so I could listen to it. I can still see myself sitting in my dad's living room, my head right over the speaker and reading along with all of the songs. I was only 10. I loved it. I just loved it. I didn't understand the crystal meth, go down on me, after we did it by the window seal in ""I Want You"", hell I still don't understand some of it. But I don't care. It was simply the most beautiful sound I had ever heard. I'm 19 now. And I look at that cd and smile so much. Third Eye Blind is my life. I remember my childhood so well because of them.Rock on guys. I can't live without it.","My Favorite Memory. I still remember. I was in the 6th grade. I heard Semi Charmed Life and I just loved it.

1,Caught in the Crossfire,"This book movingly describes what must be the nightmare of every mother of a child who cares about justice. Lori Berenson, in Peru because she cares about the poor, was arrested and sentenced to life in prison. If Lori were a CEO wanted because she had poisoned the landscape, the United States government would have shielded her from this fate. Witness Warren Anderson, CEO of Union Carbide, sentenced to death in absentia in India for his role in the Bhopal disaster that killed tens of thousands: the United States shields him. But Lori's fate, heartwrenchingly described in this fastreading book, has been vastly different, as has the response of the US government. We can only hope that this book will help to improve Lori's conditions, or even set her free. If any book can do that, this one can.","Caught in the Crossfire.

1,'Space Daze'(Cleopatra) Varioua Artists,"As long as this 2-CD release has been out, I couldn't believe that no one had ever reviewed it before. 'Space Daze' is a decent 2-CD retrospect that is mainly for 'new patrons' who might need a proper introduction to the field of electronic, ambient, space rock and underground progressive music. Also might serve the purpose of giving a nifty piece of classic and some more recent recordings of the featured artists to an old school fan of such genres. A couple of the tracks on here, for example drew me to the original disc to where the tune was culled from, like Delerium's ""Dark Matter"", I went out and purchased the CD. Same with Pressurehed's ""Silver Bird"" and The Orb's ""Blue Room"". Other works I found enlightening include Hawkwind's B-side ""Adjust Me"", Ozric's ""Sploosh"", Spiral Realm's ""Elements"" and Coil's ""Nasa Arab"". Very nice to pull out and listen to now and then. Great cover, don't you think?","'Space Daze'(Cleopatra) Varioua Artists. As long as this 2-CD release has been out, I couldn't believe that no one had ever reviewed it before.

0,Not as helpful as I would have hoped,"As I began this book I had hoped to get information about the causes, treatments and dietary advice for someone diagnosed with hypoglycemia. I was disappointed that this was not the information I felt the book delivered. The book failed the reader in explaining hypoglycemia. It provided alot of antecdotal evidence to support its claims. In addition much of its advice was undoable by the average person - it included suggestions to use only full spectrum light, avoid the use of microwave ovens, eat only fertile eggs and drink only raw milk. I am eager to control my hypoglycemia but couldn't help but wonder at the validity of much of this advice.","Not as helpful as I would have hoped.

1,Lovely Boneas is awesome!!!!!!!!,"Lovely Bones is a great book about a fourteen year-old girl named Susie Salmon who was brutally murdered by a neighbor. The story is told by her as she wathches down on Earth from her heaven. She looks down and wathches her brother and sister grow and her parents slowly drift apart. My favorite part of the book was when Susies mother, Abigail, came back home. She felt like such a jerk for leaving all those years. She miised her two children grow-up and it was very akward for all of them. Lovely Bones is an amazing book. it should be read by all. Alice sebold does an incredible job of describing many things like death. I would definitly recomend this book to all.

I also loved the fact that she had gained weight for the role and honestly she looked better--but she waddled. Annoying. She was hillarious as she reminded me of my friends and I in her quest for love. Something always seems to go wrong.

Such factual information says it is somehow possible to fit millions of species onto one giant ark that according to the decriptions in the bible, was far too small to fit them.., and yet still had to cary all the food required for them to live...Hard to call people liars when making those claims I should think.","The Lie: This book.

1,Common problem in America - parents spoiling kids,"The author describes the two suspects well. He details their relationship and activities following the murders. A second book by Smith should follow. Didn't anyone see Joel's vehicle parked around the block, the day of the murders?We need to know the final judicial outcome. Also, I would like to know how this has affected the girlfriends of Dana and Joel. Did Dana or Joel ever learn what remorse is?Smith describes Dana as being overindulged with a Mercedes, etc. Since his mother had a ""career"", she supplied Dana with all kinds of money. It obviously was the wrong kind of attention any child needs. Although, Dana Ewell made the ultimate ""choice"" to do wrong.","Common problem in America - parents spoiling kids.

1,WOW!,"Well, I saw other DVD players for less, but I had a budget of three bills to spend so I opted for this one... and what a great choice I made... if I do say so myself.In a nutshell it's easy to get started (the twelve year old had it up and running without opening the book... although I hooked up the wires) and it's got the complex features for us tech saavy enthusiasts (I'm still tweaking the advanced settings).The picture is as sharp and crisp as I want (using super-video outputs) and the 5.1 channel sound makes everything go bump in the night just like it should from the crunch of crisp dry leaves under foot to the celery like snap of a cervical vertebra (don't watch horror flicks alone with the 6 channel surround sound activated).Overall, I'm very happy with this one!!!","WOW!.

0,music intended to portray spiritual death,"I saw KOYAANISQATSI when it was first released in 1983 at a special showing outdoors at the Petrillo Bandshell in Grant Park in Chicago. It was a powerful experience, with the city skyline for a backdrop. I well recall my feeling at the time, that the images were provocative and moving, but the music was intensely annoying. I WANT to like it. I fully sympathize with the message of the film, which is that our ""civilization"" is out of balance with ""nature."" I absolutely believe that we need nothing less than an ecological revolution before we destroy any more of the planet. Compassion for all sentient beings! But after repeated listening, I find the soundtrack to be yet another symptom of our out-of-sync society. I have the same reaction to most of Glass's music.If you are interested in minimalism, I recommendTerry Riley's IN CandSteve Reich's MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS(see my reviews of both). These are works of beauty that may be part of the cure.Namasthe!","music intended to portray spiritual death.

0,Worse than one star.,"The buzz I remember from this when it was a theatrical release was how Natalie Portman's nude scenes were cut. Aparently they also cut the interesting and engaging dialog also. This could not have been any worse if they cast the teletubbies as the 4 characters as the actors. For the guys out there the strip club scenes did not have any nudity. Not that a film needs nudity, but this was a symptom of the pollitically correct crowd ruining a film. Not at all believeable acting. This film should be banned as a terrorist act.I hated it, and threw out my copy, rather than sell it and subject someone else to it.","Worse than one star..

As with the earlier recording, but even more so this time, I found Stargazer to be quite tedious. Oncer again, there were some interesting moments, but the most part, the performances were overly earnest and overly busy. Drummer Baron especially overplays his part this time around, just overdoing it and not letting the music breathe. I think I could maybe have enjoyed this CD had a different, more subtle drummer been employed and I have heard Baron do much better on many other recordings -- not sure what the problem was on this outing), but in the end, this recording simply wore out my patience.","My Ears Glaze Over.

There isn't enough hardware to keep the thing together and it broke almost immediately despite very gentle use by my mature seven-soon to be eight- year old. She was devastated. I found a much better dollhouse by Imaginarium that is almost the same price as this. To me the extra 10.00 is worth it knowing that my daughter will have a dollhouse she can actually USE.

1,A college guy's view,"Although this book was not the most current at my school library, I found it during first grade, and had to get special permission to check it out, because it was a chapter book. My mom and I read a half chapter a night on school nights and a full chapter on Saturdays and Sundays to get it finished before the due date two weeks later. Each October thereafter, I checked this book out, until it came up missing/stolen when I was in sixth grade. I went from reading the story with my mom to reading it all on my own. The intertwining of history, a ghost story and the lives of three relatively ordinary kids kept bringing me back for more. Now in college, my fond memories of this book started my search to read it again.","A college guy's view.

1,This book should be on every beginner's shelf,"One of our most prolific chess writers, Eric Schiller has again produced a most useful volume in his usual clear and concise style. Not intended to be the last word on chess, the Encyclopedia fulfills its promise of extracting practical nuggets useful for beginners and intermediate players from his own experience, the classic chess literature, and tournament play. Dr. Schiller truly does have an encyclopedic knowledge of the game and cites cogent examples from classic and contemporary play to illustrate his points. This is an easy book to browse in, and the reader will invariably come away with some tidbit that will enhance his/her understanding of the general principles of openings, middle game, end game, tactics,and strategy. Especially recommended for serious beginners.","This book should be on every beginner's shelf.

This movie IS a masterpiece thanks to its compulsively viewable nature, although it has dated somewhat (Dustin's hair always looks a bit 70s).

0,What was the plot about again?,"I enjoyed the first X-Men movie not only because it was so thrilling to see a live-action adaptation of a cherished comic book series, but also because it had a plot that made sense and it didn't go (too), over-the-top. The sequel, X-Men 2, was still very enjoyable because the plot was consistent to the end and the action sequences were not as overdone as MI:2. X-Men 3 was THOROUGHLY dissapointing for me because it tried so hard to pack in everything it could, to the detriment of the plot. I found myself wondering why this series of mismatched scenes were jumbled together when there should have been a very solid plotline to follow. Were we to focus on Jean Gray? Archangel? Magneto? What was the movie about other than an excuse to go WAY over-the-top on every sequence and barely work on character development. What a pity the last movie was so thrown together.","What was the plot about again?.

1,ghost world,"So I've been watching some cult type movies recently. The ones that are referenced all the time, or half the people on livejournal have an icon of. Ghost world is one of those movies. I had no idea what the plot was about before I watched it. ( I was hoping it would be a supernatural movie, but alas, it is not)I think its a good drama with some funny parts. The characters are realistic and likeable. Some parts make you think, oh that's like me, or thats like how so and so behaves. Which isn't seen very often in movies, perhaps thats why people like this so much. I dont think it's arty, though. Parts I didn't like: the bus thing, and what happened when she got drunk, and her typical 'I'm unique, really' scene/emo look. The rest I liked pretty much. The part where her teacher is analyzing someone piece of rubbish art is very true to life (turner prize, anyone?). It's a nice comedy drama type movie, and I would watch it again. Good acting too.

1,Worth the effort,"A great many critics (here, too) claim Kyle has written a book that is very much hampered by his excruciating tendency to relate the most obscure details. While this is true, it in no way detracts from the merits of this great book. It may not be the most pleasant read on the 1956 Suez Crisis, but it is hard to find any other account that is as complete as Kyle's. For scholars and students Suez: Britain's End of Empire in the Middle East contains a wealth of useful information. If readers want personal colour (or, in Shuckburgh's case, to be distracted), they should read Shuckburgh's diary (note his words on his garden flowers), Nuttings account or Eden's biography by Rhodes James.","Worth the effort.

0,Bad advice for selecting an architect,"Mr. Callahan's advice for selecting an architect is very bad advice. If a Building Committee follows his advice they will not receive the professional architectural services that they deserve. I am an architect who has specialized in designing churches for over 20 years.

1,AWESOME!!,"I agree with every single thing that 'prettynpink' wrote, and when i read that review it sounded like I wrote it! This is SO much better than my venus razor! It is comfortable, and no nicks or cuts! I can shave really fast, it only takes a second. Plus, If you miss a spot, you can easily just go back over again. I originally bought this for a summer vacation in about a week or two, but I wanted to use it first to make sure i liked it, and I love it! I'm not saving this for my vacation, I'm gonna use it from now on. It's great for travel, cause you just bring one unit, not the razor and the shave gel, which is unbeleivably bulky! Another thing is that my legs don't feel as prickley the next day.","AWESOME!!. I agree with every single thing that 'prettynpink' wrote, and when i read that review it sounded like I wrote it!

0,Poor Value for Price,"I have owned the 3-2-1 system for 1 yr, 1 month and 1 week. The DVD player had to be replaced after 6 months of occasional use. Last week it failed to operate again, 6 weeks out of warranty. Also, no audio from the cable/sat setting ! The audio from my plasma TV speakers is equally as impressive in my LARGE living room. The AM/FM gives poor quality reception compared to a simple kitchen am/fm under the cabinet! DVD players are not expensive. I was impressed by the demo at the store, with a Bose DVD- at home it left me cold. Like PT Barnum said, 'there is one born every minute' Be smart and avoid this product and shop for a decent dvd/sound system.","Poor Value for Price.

1,"No ""Blues"" about the HS850","Size, convenience and function are all good on the HS850. Voice quality and ease of turning on and off work well. Does not fall off the ear with any motion and is very comfortable. Needs charging on a separate charge from the phone and a little more frequently. When the arm folds in, the Bluetooth is easy to carry in pocket or purse. It is about the size of a large button. While night driving the blue flash can be a distraction to some passengers.","No ""Blues"" about the HS850. Size, convenience and function are all good on the HS850.

0,Cindy Sheehan's Favorite CD,"I'm not a hardcore Ministry fan, but I have enjoyed a few of their CD's from the past. Sometimes I need to hear something with heavy industrial edge to it, and Ministry does it.I got this CD and I like the music to it. The lyrics however, ruin the album for me. I respect people's political opinions whether I agree with them or not. But this is kind of absurd. Even if I hated Bush, I would still find this type of propaganda annoying, especially in a band that I like to listen to. I'm not a Bush hater, but I'm not a Bush lover either, thats for sure.If you can get past the propaganda lyrics, then its not too bad. The music itself is heavy as hell. I suggest previewing tracks before buying. I would rate the music part of it at 5, but its not enjoyable due to the lyrics. I assume if you dont agree to this review you are a hardcore liberal with no open mind.","Cindy Sheehan's Favorite CD.

0,I was not impressed,"I found the book annoying for example the so-called hero had these episodes where he could only be calmed by sucking at the heroine's breasts,most of the situations were demeaning to both sexes ,there was very little genuine tenderness or feeling. If it was meant to be Science Fiction it was a flop, witness the scene where the woman gives birth to an egg that contained their children, as for erotica, it left me feeling kind of queasy - in one village the women were not only forced to go around naked they also had to wear collars and leashes ,in another section they had to sit with their legs wide open exposing themselves, I guess it caters more to the bondage crowd,but to me the prose itself seemed rather unimaginative and juvenile.I guess this really does come down to personal preferences","I was not impressed.

0,Way too much summary,"While the story of how ""Andele"" was captured and grew up experiencing the unfamiliar Indian life is interesting and somewhat intriguing, the way it is told has too much summary. There is very little dialouge in the chapters so you really do not feel for any of the characters in the story or anything that happens to them. While it is mostly Andele's story, the book sidetracks to talk about other people's lives, so it distracts from the main storyline. It is a quick read which is nice, but is not a typical novel. I can only recommend it to the younger crowd, since it reads like a fictional storytelling.","Way too much summary.

1,Surprisingly great album!!,"After hearing Michelle's second hit single ""All You Wanted"" I thought to myself...""hmmm this girl could go somewhere."" So I finally picked up the album a few weeks ago. Before I listened to it I didn't really have high expectations and thinking that it would probably be full of sappy ballads. Well to my surprise there was only one slow song and that is the last one ""Drop in the Ocean."" I only had to listen to this cd once to fall in love with it. It is a big PLUS in my book for the singer to have written their own material and Michelle both writes and plays her own guitar! I like all the songs on this album but my favorite of hers is definitely ""Here With Me."" Not only it this song catchy but it seems as if it was written by myself because I can relate to it so well. Other stand out tracks are ""Everywhere"",""All You Wanted"",""You Set Me Free"", and ""Sweet Misery.""Great job Michelle!!! Can't wait for the next album!","Surprisingly great album!!. After hearing Michelle's second hit single ""All You Wanted"" I thought to myself...""hmmm this girl could go somewhere."" So I finally picked up the album a few weeks ago. Before I listened to it I didn't really have high expectations and thinking that it would probably be full of sappy ballads. Well to my surprise there was only one slow song and that is the last one ""Drop in the Ocean."" I only had to listen to this cd once to fall in love with it.

1,No bones about it...,"This is a super value! My husband is taking an Anatomy college course & got our 4 year old son hooked on skeletons. Receiving this as a gift, we are quite pleased with its durability & how anatomically correct this toy is (compared to other toy skeletons we've seen). The only negative thing I can comment on is that some of the bone sizes are slightly out of proporation. It is a great learning toy for children. If you want more accurate detail, your going to have to pay the price.","No bones about it.... This is a super value!

0,"The bad news is, it's short.....","the good news is, it's short. Poor Anita, we hardly know you anymore. This entry into the Anita Blake is big on sex and very very small on plot. I guess it's a novella, so I should not be making an issue about its length, but in addition to having few pages, this book has very little substance. I read it and felt like I hadn't really learned anything about Anita; or Micah, for that matter. I would so much more enjoy this series of books if Ms Hamilton could make the plots more interesting, reduce the gratuitous ""porn"" segments, describe more about Anita's work without slipping into metaphysical cliches, and, because this bothers me a LOT, get a better editor to avoid numerous misspellings and repetition of phrases. Because the Anita Blake books were SO interesting and entertaining at the beginning of the series, I hope that Ms Hamilton takes many reviewers' advice and change the direction in which that this series is going.","The bad news is, it's short...... the good news is, it's short.

0,A New World Disordered,"David J Knowles' book of poetry, ""A New World Ordered & Delivered"", is an unsettling look at American life. Written with an ultra-right wing slant, this collection of jingoistic, luddite verse is pedantic and dull, offering little in the way of wit or real insight, despite claims to the contrary. This is the type of thinking that gives free reign to hatred and intolerance, and feeds a growing ignorance among the populace. Mr. Knowles was apparently also offered very little by way of an editor: the book is replete with spelling and grammatical errors, which could either distract from his ""message"", or, more likely, point out just how ill-informed that message is.It is also interesting to note, considering that Mr. Knowles is decidedly ""anti-materialism"", that the asking price for a book which is essentially a laminated 17-page photocopy is... steep... All in all, a very disappointing read.","A New World Disordered. David J Knowles' book of poetry, ""A New World Ordered & Delivered"", is an unsettling look at American life.

0,don't overload it,I have had the unit for about 2+ years. It is a very good 'blower'. For the first time in the 2 years I've owned it I decided to vacuum some leaves. There must have been a clump of wet ones that got sucked up into it. Within seconds the motor began to burn up. I noticed one of the blades had broken too. With the broken blade it caused it to be unbalanced and consequently did not function well. Conclusion: good blower but be wary of using it as a vacuum.,don't overload it.

1,A great movie.,"This movie is excellent. It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative. It is a murder mystery with a twist. The movie is played in reverse chronological order with the occasional flash-back (which is a flash-forward in the movie time line) that gives you the perpsective of the hero (Leonard). He suffered a brain injury during a crime and remembers everything before the crime, but after it has no long term memory. He can only recall things that happened within minute or so. This means he has to make notes to give himeself cues and clues as to his current history as he tries to discover who murdered his wife.This is a movie you are going to want watch more than once.","A great movie..

Guterson wrote as if he were a poet, great adjectives and verbs, but he forgot to add mystery to the tale.

When the notch is too little the top of the leg does not sit flush with the mounted board when screwed together.

0,This movie is an insult to the image portrayed by the book.,"This movie is an insult to the image portrayed by Frank Herbert in his Dune books. Not only does it ignore some of the most important aspects which Frank Herbert included in his books, but it is also neglegent in that it does not show any real cinematic quality. The internal monologes are long and often incomprehensible unless the viewer has read the book version, and even then there is confusion in that the movie does not corespond with the book in many aspects.","This movie is an insult to the image portrayed by the book..

First, the music is very drawn out. Even the people speaking in the video speak verg monotonic. And the singing? Gosh, awful singing! Wish they can spice it up with more upbeat people or use music that's catchy.Even though my child is only 6 mo, she knows which DVD sucks (looks elsewhere, wiggles out of her bumbo) and which is more entertaining (sits in her Bumbo, eyes glued to the your baby can read dvds). I am no spokesperson for YBCR nor do I absolutely love their products but the YBCR songs are very catchy, entertaining, and thus, keep your child's attention longer for the learning to take place.","Awful!

0,Books made of paper are cheaper... why?,"The Kindle is a great concept. The lack of back up for subscription content is definitely a con. As is the weight. But the worst con of all is: Why are the electronic books so expensive?? The average paperback is only $7. That is with all the materials, shipping, etc... costs. An ebook is only digital data sent directly to the Kindle unit. Why is it $10+ a book?? I would much rather go to Barnes and Nobles and pick up a paperback. No back up issues and much cheaper.

1,Don't wait any longer!,"This album is great listening from beginning to end. It is distinctively New Order in style retaining characteristic elements from throughout the group's long and important career - all tracks are excellent but I'd especially recommend the first three plus ""Turn"". The chord changes are so seamless, the compositions so perfect, that as a listener I experienced disbelief that such a masterpiece is not more widely recognized. I was very pleasantly surprised by this album - it's now my favorite New Order album, with an edge over Republic and Get Ready, my previous preferences. I listen to 'Siren' several times a week and it doesn't get old. If you like New Order then I doubt you'll be disappointed by this one. If you've never listened to New Order this would be a really superb introduction.","Don't wait any longer!. This album is great listening from beginning to end.

0,Cuisinart Popcorn Maker,Makes great popcorn until it breaks and it will break. I've gone through 2 of these in a very short time. The 1st one broke where the electrical connections make contact. I thought maybe I got a lemon so I'll give the machine a second chance. The second one broke even quicker than the first. This one broke at the release buttons used to connect and disconnect the stirrer/heating portion of the machine from the base.I will not work because this also holds the electrical connections together. These poppers are junk. Enough is enough. I gave up and bought a simpler machine that does work great.The West Bend Stir Crazy (Costs around $30.00).Try it I think you will agree.

0,Falls Apart,"I bought this toy for my child for X-mas thinking it looks awesome in the box! That was until I opened it and there are a million pieces and one paper with a picture of how it should look after you put it together. Terrible! It falls apart if you look at it hard enough. The ""buttons"" you push to make gates open up do not open, you have to mash them to get them to work or pry them open with your hands and then it pulls apart anyways. If you super glue it into place it's fine but for the money I spent on it- not worth it. We have lots of other Imaginext toys that are great, So I do beleive it was just poor construction on this toy. Comes with alot of cool pieces to play with.","Falls Apart.

0,I Didn't Expect a Whole Lot for the Price.,"The product arrived on time, straight from Hong Kong. It only works every once in a while with Apple products. When I plug in the USB it will charge for a few minutes and then stop. Since it mentioned iPods in the description, this is what I purchased it for. Also, there is a red light that illuminates indicating that it is plugged in. The red light is incredibly bright and somewhat distracting when driving at night. Also, the light doesn't turn off when your car is turned off, so it acts as if it were a light house notifying all car burglars of possible electronics in the car. But like I mentioned in the title, I didn't expect a whole lot for the price.","I Didn't Expect a Whole Lot for the Price.. The product arrived on time, straight from Hong Kong.

0,I couldn't put it together!!,"I'm not rating the furniture or Simplicity, I'm rating Baby Universe for shipping the wrong furniture. I didn't notice that they sent a combo of the Walnut and Cherry changing tables from the Ellis line. So, when my friends and I attempted to put it together, the screw holes on the cabinet pieces didn't line up. I thought that maybe it was me, so I called my cousin, the handy-man, to see if he could fix it. As we looked closer, we noticed that some pieces were lighter than others. Simplicity instructs you to call them if something's wrong and I did. They're sending an entirely new unit to me and will pay for shipping to return the faulty/unmatched unit. I'm due in 2 weeks so I'm purchasing a playpen/changing table/bassinet in case I deliver before Simplicity does.","I couldn't put it together!!.

1,"Great, but could've been better","I really liked the first two (Lounge against the machine, Tuxicity), and I like this one as well. However, the problem with the cd is that many of the tracks aren't really songs but rather clips from lives and tv that have him talking. It's better to keep to the Songs. Some of the covers aren't as good as on the other album.Anyway, I still recommend the CD because I enjoy listening to it and some of the songs are worth it.","Great, but could've been better.

I was a casual baseball fan before I saw it, and after seeing it one inning a time over the course of several weeks I could not wait for the season to start. That was just about 3 years ago, and I am now 40.It takes you through an entire range of emotions as it depicts a general history of baseball. There isn't a lot of in depth material and its scope is limited, but consider that baseball has been in existence for well over 100 years by the time it was made, and explain how one would cover any more in the time he was alloted.I recommend this not just for baseball fans, but anyone interested in American history. Baseball is the focus, but as often it is used as a parallel and a metaphor to culture in its time.","not just a game. This series is the best mini-series I have ever seen.

This season does not have an out-takes feature.No comedy on TV should release a DVD without a bloopers reel. Scrubs has always been known for the best bloopers. It's why many of us shell out $25-$30 for the season as soon as it hits the shelves. Interviews with the cast and crew are only valuable to the cast and crew, and deleted scenes are useful to remind the writers that you care about them. But the audience wants to be entertained with more than what we can see on Comedy Central in a few months. Seriously, the show is in syndication now, and the value of the actual episodes goes way south after that.Give me more to make me laugh.","NO BLOOPERS!!!.

With 500 photos, SO MUCH has been left out, especially the work of the exceptional ""functional potters"" who may be ubiquitous but many of whom still produce beautiful work. The emphasis in this book is on the decorative piece that goes on a shelf. In addition facing pictures often detract from one another, another statement of poor choices.","A Big Disappointment.

I picked up four from the library, based on reviews I've read here. I hope one or two of the others are better. I hate wasting my valuable reading time on such mediocre material.The theme of this book is ""poor me"" by a self-absorbed rich kid who was given everything in the world, and had a few upsetting moments, with which she filled this book.

1,Work fine for me..,"I am not sure how other reviewers used this, but I had no problem after 2 years. To be fair, I primarily used the toothbrush only on trips (I had another rechargeable at home), but my usually lasted a week at a time and I make these trips at least everyother week. Oh, I also brushed at least twice a day.I agree that the bottom cap and o-ring are not exactly the best, but I have no problem with water coming in. After brushing, I rinsed the whole thing and left it stand vertically. I am on my 3rd set of batteries now. For me, it was a $25 well spent. I like it because I can get battery for it anywhere. I would buy another when this one dies someday. The only thing this toothbrush needs is pausing every 30 seconds like its other models.11/16/09:3 months since my last review, my tooth brush died.

1,LA girl in fashion landscape and a pretty turn of phrase,"Autobiographical, revealing, intimate, and touchingly confessional, like many first novels. Do we want to peek at the internal, frustrated and narcissistically driven lives of the sophisticated LA fashionable? You bet. Odd thing is Dana comes off likeable and sympathetic, think Shopgirl, think Pretty Woman. Do we have another voice for the romantically overstimulated hot set? Think High Fidelity and John Cusack. We'll wait and see. Look what happened to Michael Chabon with this kind of introspective, self-examination. Pulitzer Prize. Go Dana. Keep it up. I will buy the next one, gladly. You folks out there with your own literary minded yearnings - buy Dana's book. She could use the encouragement, the admiration, the movie deal.","LA girl in fashion landscape and a pretty turn of phrase.

1,A thoughtfully complex reading experience,"I sometimes rush through novels rather quickly. With this one, I kept reading it a little a time, even switching to other novels that I had told someone I'd read. However, I never lost interest in it. Something about this book made me keep wanting to enjoy it over time, and it almost disappointed me when I reached the end. I loved the ending, and the entire book, but its episodic nature and its wild mixture of narrative devices made it a reading experience I kept wanting to sustain. The main character's relationships with his mother, his lovers, and the world bring up a host of insecurities, further complicated by AIDS, materialism, and deep longings. John Weir makes readers laugh, while he treats them to a thoughtfully complex reading experience.(Duane Simolke's books include The Acorn Stories, Degranon, and New Readings of Winesburg, Ohio.)","A thoughtfully complex reading experience.

Besides the title cut, selections from the Telemann ""Suite in a minor"" will be appreciated by flute teachers and performers, as well as other works transcribed for flute. The Albnioni ""Adagio"" is particularly haunting and could be a new addition to the repertoire. Handel's ""Queen of Sheba"" is also nicely done.

0,Not worth the money!,"I was really disappointed with this product. For one thing, the keyboard does not plug into the computer or interact with the software at all. You can buy the software separately, which I would recommend, because this keyboard is not worth $80.00. It had mid-sized keys which are small. My next complaint is that the software only teaches rhythm and what the notes on the piano are. It does not teach a child how to read sheet music. My daughter (6 yrs old) got through the whole software CD in less than 2 hrs. She still can't read sheet music or play songs. She learned a small amount of music theory, which, I could have taught her for free. Finally, they say there is another CD that is Level 2, which there isn't. I have scoured the internet trying to find the next level and it appears not to have been released. So now I am not sure what to do. Way too expensive at $120.00.

0,Not the best jigsaw,"I picked up this jigsaw because of the relatively low price and because my father has a B&D jigsaw that has never given him any problems. I also liked the quick clamp blade system.For light work around my house the saw does an adequate job. However, as soon as I cut anything tougher than 3/4 inch particle board I notice the blade wandering. At first, I thought I was feeding the saw too fast but even when creeping through the material (pine 1x6 as well as a 1 3/8 inch solid core door) the blade still wanders.Additionally, the dust blower/extractor doesn't work very well.Finally, this little saw really gives you a workout from all of the vibration that it produces.If you only need a light duty jigsaw and don't want to spend a bunch of money, this saw will work for you. If you will be cutting tougher stock, I would recommend spending the extra money and going with a higher end saw (personally, I have my eye on the new Bosch jigsaw, as 6.4 amps should cut through anything).","Not the best jigsaw.

1,"Nice writing style, great images","This book was really well done. The images of thunderstorms, clouds, tornadoes and various rare weather events are just wonderful. The writer's style is casual and friendly. I really liked the way he would toss in interesting tidbits amoung the technical scientific writing---he'd be writing in depth about how tornadoes form, and would mention as an aside a restaurant all the tornado chasers liked! Anyone who has a fascination for tornadoes will really enjoy this book.","Nice writing style, great images. This book was really well done.

0,Poor Production -- Fair Performance,"The lighting, editing, and camera work for this video is poor. Regardless, I watch live performances for the music. The sound recording was good, but I have mixed opinions about the performance. Mic was GREAT. Lindsey and Stevie were also great, but Christie was unemotional -- kinda like a non-chalet reporter. John was okay, but let's face it -- he's not much of a bass player.","Poor Production -- Fair Performance. The lighting, editing, and camera work for this video is poor.

He is able to track his walks and keep track of how far he walks each walk. The visuals are very good.

0,Way over hyped,"Malcolm Crow is a child psycholigist, but one of his patientse kills himself and shoots Malcolm, he wants to succeed with his next one. His next child is Cole, a young boy who can see dead people. At first Malcolm doesn't believe the boy but he starts to help him out and slowly beging to believe the boy. Malcolm is also having problems with his wife, she doesn't seem to love him that much anymore. Ok, what is the deal with this movie, it's not bad but it's not great. It's no where near as good as it's made out to be nor is it scary. The ending is really predictable, I can't believe no one saw it coming. The movie has some good points, a few good sub plots involving a dead girl tring to call Cole for help. This movie would of been alot better if the plot wasn't known, but it was, Malcolm spend the first half of the movie trying to figure out what is wrong with the kid, it would of been better if we didn't know beforehand either.","Way over hyped.

0,TRY AND DE-CYPHER THIS ONE,"I've always enjoyed watching Jeremy Northam's work, whether in the sci fi classic MIMIC or the oh so proper GOSFORD PARK. But not even the usually suave Northam can save CYPHER from being a cinematic mess. It's premise of corporate espionage and it's mysterious underlying theme is initially intriguing and holds your interest, even though it's slow moving. But as the movie throws twist upon twist and never really validates these twists, it becomes more of an incomplete jigsaw puzzle than a complete movie. Lucy Liu struggles through a role that requires her to look seductive, but whose monotonous delivery negates any impact the actress could have. Although stylishly done, CYPHER is one of those movies you should be glad you rented and didn't buy.","TRY AND DE-CYPHER THIS ONE.

1,Excellent pump.,"Does exactly what it is supposed to. Fills inflatables quickly, noise level is average for a powered pump, decent cord length (could probably be a bit longer since it does not include a hose-extension). In terms of pressure, you'll get more than enough pressure to fill most standard inflatables and rafts fully (I have a party island raft that fills quickly and fully). But inflatable boats such as kayaks and white-water rafts would probably need a stronger pump (or need to be topped off manually).","Excellent pump.. Does exactly what it is supposed to.

0,Big Disappointment,"I was very excited to use this cookbook, as I've made all of my 10-month-old's food since he started eating solids at 6 months. I was interested in finding some new and different recipes, so I thought I'd give this book a try after reading other reviews. I enjoyed some of the first few chapters, which talked about everything from food safety and the nutrients in food to organic vs. non-organic. Unfortunately, I've found the recipes to be terrible. Not one I've tried has turned out; they've been awful. I consider myself to be a fairly good home cook. I cook every day and make many recipes for our family from foodnetwork.com and epicurious.com that come out perfectly. I follow the recipes in this book exactly, but nothing I've tried has been worth eating, and it's so frustrating to waste such good, organic ingredients! I wouldn't recommend this book.

There is definitely more fiction than fact in this book.

But it seems to me that Hays wanted to write a novel and so tried to come up with many new ideas, incidents, and suppositions. My concern is that people will read this and think that this is the true story about St. Francis. It is not, sadly. Rather, it is a fictional tale about a great saint.","More fiction than fact.

0,"Hated the movie, but the DVD quality is good","I really, really didn't like this movie but was compelled to buy it anyway. It's got some nice classical music in the soundtrack, and the physical and technical quality of the DVD is good. So if the physical product is what I'm rating, then I give it high marks. But if it's the movie itself that I'm rating, I'd give it a zero. Overblown, pretentious piffle that masquerades as profundity but is really just a glib exploration of Terrence Malick's inflated ego, copiously illustrated with dinosaurs, Southern violence, and milk clouds.","Hated the movie, but the DVD quality is good.

1,Works as intended,"We bought this for quick clean ups under the dining room table after meals, or other defined uses where lugging out the big vacuum would be a pain. This works pretty well. I was surprised that the brush function works well. It is not as powerful as I'd thought in terms of suction, but with the brush motor, it has not disappointed. We also like the fact that it is fairly wide, so makes the jobs quicker.","Works as intended.

0,Horrible Phone,"I bought this phone for the cordless speakerphone feature. All I ended up with was a headache. This first phone continued to fade in and out while you were talking regardless if you held the handset or talked on the speakerphone so it was practically useless. After contacting Panasonic I was sent an exchange refurbished phone (I paid full price for a new phone, not a refurbished one). This one was worst than the first. After charging for 12 hours it will only hold a charge for a 5 minute conversation before dying. I'm very disappointed after spending $50. Please consider a different brand.","Horrible Phone.

1,Greatly surpassed my expectations!,"I love this shoji screen! Purchased the 5 panel in Honey. I needed a screen on each side of a window so I removed two hinges and am now using 3 panels on one side and 2 panels on the other side. The honey color is much richer and more beautiful than as pictured. Hinges are very nice quality and are double-hinged so each panel can move in either direction, a nice feature! Rice paper is soft and thick while still letting diffused light through, beautiful! Oriental Furniture delivered FedEX very quickly and a day earlier than the estimated delivery window. Packaging was excellent. I recommend this screen from Oriental Furniture very highly.","Greatly surpassed my expectations!. I love this shoji screen! Purchased the 5 panel in Honey.

1,My favorite movie,"this is the best movie i've ever seen. I love A-PIX movies because they are so dumb, that they are hilarious. This is the best one yet. I've never laughed so hard at a movie that wasn't supposed to be funny. The movie is about a movie editor that replaces and old one, and he goes crazy, and starts to kill everyone. To tell how dumb this movie is, i'll describe the beginning. There is a crazy movie editor cutting up all of these movie tapes. His boss tries to get in, but the door is locked. The boss finally breaks down the door, and movie editor, who had put a grenade in his mouth, blows up. The boss responds with, ""You're Fired!"" If you need a good laugh, then watch this movie, or, if you want to see the dumbest movie ever, then I also recommend this movie. - CIAO !!!","My favorite movie. this is the best movie i've ever seen.

1,"Good, comfortable dress shoe, but not ideal","This is a good, basic dress shoe, true to size. I normally wear a 6 regular width in Naturalizer shoes but decided to purchase the 'Wide' version of the shoe in this instance. I have the Naturalizer 'Rogers' pumps in a size 6 and found them to be very tight and uncomfortable for my toes. I added a heel pad in the Destins to take care of the little bit of extra room back there and that has given them a good fit for my feet. The pumps are not as comfortable as Naturalizer's Movalo or Prissy sandals--which I think are exceptionally good shoes--but good and comfortable.","Good, comfortable dress shoe, but not ideal.

1,"5 stars for first program, 3 for second...","The first documentary giving us a glimpse of 5 cats, the cheetah, the leopard, the serval, the caracal, and lions, is outstanding. The memory of the aftermath of a fight between four male lions from one pride and two male lions from another will stay with me forever, truly awesome! Coupled with some great shots of cubs of all sorts and their mothers, this is a documentary worth seeing over and over.The second documentary, concerning the jaguar, is a disappointment despite some beautiful shots. It is filmed at an extremely slow space and with the jaguar itself representing just 20% of the entire program, the rest on various animals, birds, and insects in the jungle. The shots of the jaguar are memorable but too few and far between, hence the 3 star rating for this documentary, and probably generous at that. The first program more than makes up for this though.

1,Perfect,"This album combines exceptional, interesting, stylistically disparate tunes, luscious electronic orchestration, unrelenting drive and an uncanny sense of artistic unity. It is a ""dance album"" pretty much in a class by itself. Leftfield, before disbanding, also created a formidable body of EP releases and remixes. Their second album, Rhythm and Stealth, is also full of shimmeringly beautiful cuts - though without the unifying ""comet ride"" impulse of this album and the easy acceptance that often greets the familiar - in the case of Leftism, it's comfortable place in the dance bin.To repeat: if you like hard-driving dance music and glorious electronica, this is a truly distinguished disk.","Perfect.

0,Holes...,"The gore in this movie was impressive. However, that's where the greatness ends. There are so many holes in the plot that it appears that the writer just tacked on an ending, like ""hey, this might be neat"". There isn't much that leads up to the ending that could ever lead one to guess it. That's not in a good way either. There's a big difference between a surprise ending and an ending that just doesn't add up.

If she wasn't in the wreck, then she wouldn't have any visible signs of being in a wreck. The plot could have been something great, if they would have followed through.

I can't believe they did that.Also, Charlton Heston is in the movie,for like what, 5 minutes? Even with all these flaws, its a good movie.","WHAT?!! ALMOST NO CHARLTON HESTON!!?.

1,Not what I thought it would be,"I purchased this book thinking that it also dealt with ""girls"" who have lost their fathers. My father passed when I was 4 years old and this was not the book for me. I didn't read the entire book, once I got into chapter one, I knew it didn't pertain to me. So, to help those of you who may want to purchase this book, it's really written for the age range of upper teens through adults of any age. It's also written to appeal to those who have had fairly good/ healthy relationships with their dads. I hope this review helps, I rated it 4 stars because it does seem very well written (what I read of it).","Not what I thought it would be.

1,A carefully constructed read.,"This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's ""How to get control of time and your life"", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background.","A carefully constructed read..

My computer now thought that the unit was a 3.5"" floppy drive. Calling DRTech's help line was an exercise in futility (""please leave your name, models#, and problem and we'll get back to you in 24 hours"").

1,The beginnings of Conservative thought.,"This critique of the French Revolution is the first shot across the bow in the Conservative movement. Basically, Burke rightly blames the French Revolution for unleashing chaos in Europe. He contrasts the French Revolution with that of the American and makes it clear that the American is a political revolution, while the cultural, and social change in the French Revolution can only lead to a reign of terror, which it did.Indeed most revolutions based on social equality end that way. The preferable route is respect for traditions, and a set order to things. That is the essence of modern conservative thought. Read this work, then read the works of Russell Kirk, and you will become informed on the underpinnings of the conservative movement.","The beginnings of Conservative thought..

0,Junk,"I have not much to add from what everyone else has said. All they have to do it increase the run time between shakes to allow the cars to actually finish the race and this would be a toy that is fun to play with. The instructions tell you to shake it at least 7 times for maximum run time. That gets you the 3 laps if you are lucky. If you only shake it once or twice it will go around about 1 time. You do have to shake it pretty hard for it to work also. My 2 year old likes to play with it but only for about 3 minutes because you have to keep picking the cars up to shake them after about 3 laps. He gets bored with it and goes onto something else. That is about as long as I can stand it as well.Neat idea, bad follow through.","Junk. I have not much to add from what everyone else has said.

1,This is great,"What band is there out there ready to nail the coffin into CBGBs? Some say it's more ""punk"" to not like punk rock. Green Day probably agree with all that, as they accept another video award. This band evokes The Ramones as much as they do Ellen Allien. The music is strong and loud. Raumschmiere is an actual dude. This is the second album that we know of. This record sort of reminds me of the energy of bands like Death In Vegas, Nine Inch Nails, and Suicide. It is a wild trip. There are also contributions from Quasimodo Jones, Sandra Nasic, and Judith Juillerat. Half of this album is minimalist techno. Part of the sound evokes the digital hardcore days. This is not about the love fest. This is about real feelings.","This is great. What band is there out there ready to nail the coffin into CBGBs? Some say it's more ""punk"" to not like punk rock.

0,Could Have Been A Good Short Story,This is typical of King after his initial glory. It gets off to a good start and the possibilities seem interesting. But then nothing happens. There is the occasionally disembodied event but they never go anywhere. It is set in Western Pennsylvania not Maine and in the afterward the author explains why. To me this is a prime example of the reality that his publisher would print his laundry receipt and it would sell so no editor would ever have the nerve to say this is 200 pages too long. King makes his usual snide political comments. This was written in 2002 and as we know the author's concern for nutty domestic militia movements is what America had to keep its eye on at the time.

All the family -- father, mother, sister, brother, grandmother -- are rich characters in themselves. As a reader, I craved to understand their experiences and emotions. Alice Sebold does a wonderful job of bringing them all to life. Buckley, in particular, will break your heart.

I know none of you wouldn't want to be listening to music then all of a sudden you hear a small disturbance in your music. It's just really irritating because it doesn't stop.

If you've been alive for the past twenty years, you know that quality film's like BTTF are once in a life time. A must own for movie buffs to the casual watcher. Two thumbs up!","Finally!!!.

1,Really Good CD,"I love this CD. I've given almost half the tracks (five) excellent ratings, while two more get really good ratings. Of the remaining four tracks, two get good ratings and, unfortunately, two get merely OK ratings (that's why I can't give the overall CD an Excellent). In general, Enya manages to do this by producing beautiful, calming music that doesn't just fade into the background (which those two ""OKs"" do). It stays in the foreground and makes you listen to it. My specific track ratings are:1. A Day Without Rain -- 5 Stars2. Wild Child -- 5 Stars3. Only Time -- 5 Stars4. Tempus Vernum -- 2 Stars5. Deora Ar Mo Chroi -- 2 Stars6. Flora's Secret -- 4 Stars7. Fallen Embers -- 3 Stars8. Silver Inches -- 5 Stars9. Pilgrim -- 4 Stars10. One By One -- 5 Stars11. Lazy Days -- 3 Stars","Really Good CD.

0,True Metallica fans will be disappointed,Where is Kirk in this album? There are no solos in this album. Lars drumming is tight but that ringing noise gets annoying after awhile. Sounds like he's hitting pots and pans. The good side is this is definitely a heavier album and it's a with good rhythm guitars from James. The lyrics needs a little work. This album sounds incomplete and should of spent more time in the studio because it almost sounds like nu-metal.,True Metallica fans will be disappointed. Where is Kirk in this album?

1,Under rated God Sim,"This was one of my favorite games growing up. You are God and you alter terrain. Sounds simple enough. There is one guy on an uneven terrain and you must flatten out the land for him in order for him to survive. He will build a hut and expand the kingdom. As long as your terrain is flat enough, he will eventually build up a castle/kingdom and more people will come from the houses and huts. Here is the really fun part. As you are doing this, the other side of the map is also being changed with other inhabitants. Those are your peoples enemies and they will fight each other. The more people you have, the stronger your forces will be. You can elect a person to be a knight and fight off their forces individually. Once your moral meter is raised high enough, you are able to cause earthquakes, floods, volcanoes. Overall, all you are really doing is altering terrain so your people will build a society for the sole purpose of global domination.","Under rated God Sim.

0,Useless - do not buy,"I bought this product thinking it would be good to use over paper postage labels printed off my laser printer. Apparently using regular shipping tape can throw off the bar code readers USPS, UPS and FedEx use due to the shiny nature of the tape. The idea is that because this tape has a matte finish, the bar code readers can read through it without the reflective interference shiny tape would create. Each time I would try to pull a piece of this tape off it would split down the middle and I'd have an uneven piece of tape. It's also very hard to apply this tape to a label without the tape bubbling up and obscuring the bar code. I figured I must be doing something wrong...3M products are usually of excellent quality. This product, however, is a waste. I threw the full roll away.","Useless - do not buy. I bought this product thinking it would be good to use over paper postage labels printed off my laser printer.

0,Breaks after a couple months,"I would recommend purchasing this for lightweight jackets or hats and scarves only. Heavier winter jackets will cause it to steer off balance, even fall.

I have had this one for a month and it is much sturdier than this one for a comprable price. It also offers more hooks.","Breaks after a couple months.

0,A step backwards,"The topics covered in this book are very good. It is a good reference book for mechanical engineering students doing an intermediate course in turbomachinery. However, due to the numerous typing errors, the 3rd edition is actually a better book. It makes it very challenging to follow, especially for students. Also, the theory is sometimes rather cryptic and one can do with a bit more detail in places. The velocity triangles can definitely do with more detail. The section on nozzles and diffusers is good, albeit a bit short.","A step backwards. The topics covered in this book are very good.

0,Good comfort but a slight problem....,"Okay, first things first. The shoes have excellent comfort on the bottoms of your feet when running. The bad news, because the tongue is so short the edges where the shoelaces lace into end up cutting into your ankles (literally). I wore these shoes and about 10 minutes into my run, my ankles where bleeding. Blood red does not go well with white. I have however rectified a solution to this. You will have to pull out the plastic that holds the shoelaces in(they are blue in color). They are not needed and only cause problems. For me I had only needed to remove the outer plastic, but that might change for someone who is not flatfooted. If you don't like cutting up your shoes, don't buy these.","Good comfort but a slight problem..... Okay, first things first. The shoes have excellent comfort on the bottoms of your feet when running.

1,These amps ROCK !!,"I have owned a wide variety of name brand amplifiers(Rockford Fosgate, Kicker, JL Audio, Sony, HiFonics, ADS)over the years and I have found that Dual brand amplifiers perform competitively to these brands and for a much lower price. I currently have the XPA6100 bridged into 2 12"" subs, and an XPA2100 running the door speakers in my blazer and the sound is AWESOME. The bass is deep and hard, the mids and highs are crisp and clean. A lot of people refer to these as ""entry level"" equipment, but my experience is that the only thing ""entry level"" about the Dual brand is the price, and who can complain about that? I would not only reccomend this amp to people, but I am planning on installing an identical system in my wifes truck, and I can do it for around 300 dollars including all the wiring kits.","These amps ROCK !!.

1,It works,"The large diaper wrap was a little tight on my dog even with the velcro at the widest setting, and I was worried that the elastic might chafe him. The extra large size is REALLY big, though. I went back to the large size without a liner, and found that because the diaper has a flannel interior lining it works fine without any additional pad-type liner (my old dog doesn't leak much, just has trouble in the morning when he first gets up). I've got some non-elastic diaper bands in fun fabrics that I keep him in during the day (just in case) and I overnight him in the Simple Solutions elastic pants. They are the only brand I trust to leave him in overnight because they don't leak.","It works.

1,skeptical but it works!,"Like many other reviewers, I was skeptical about how effective this would be. But our chimney damper does not close all the way and it was making our family room very cold in the winter. So I decided to try this, and it works! The key is to make sure the balloon is fully inflated, so it has good contact along the entire inside of the chimney (so make sure you purchase the proper size for your chimney diameter). It took some contortions to get it fully in place above the damper, but we no longer have a draft by the fireplace and the room stays several degrees warmer in the winter. An innovative and cost-effective solution to a common problem.","skeptical but it works!. Like many other reviewers, I was skeptical about how effective this would be. But our chimney damper does not close all the way and it was making our family room very cold in the winter. So I decided to try this, and it works! The key is to make sure the balloon is fully inflated, so it has good contact along the entire inside of the chimney (so make sure you purchase the proper size for your chimney diameter).

The heroine was quite spunky--that I liked; however, I never quite understood why she was the only one who could read or who had any semblance of intelligence in that town. This story was not what I would call a beauty and the beast type tale, although the reader is lead to think it is throughout most of the book. Shame, shame!!! Romantic interludes between the heroine and the hero happen very near the end of the book, and you MUST use your own imagination--nothing explicit here. What should have been a dramatic coupling for them was a real let down for me. For those who like this type of tepid, sweet, kisses type of romance, this will probably be a good book. For those who like their romances on the steamy side, forget this book. For those who want a true beauty and the beast story, skip this book. For me? Not my cup of tea.","WHEEEERES THE BEAST??.

1,Coolness,"I don't know, maybe 4 stars would be better, because IMHO there are some songs that I'm just not patient enough to let them get rockin'. However, the good songs are *great*. ""War"" is a great song, it's kinda heavy and, listen to this, almost souds Yngwie Malmsteen infuenced. Of course, Yngwie is THE ultimate shredder and IMO the most awesome guitarist in the world today, so Joe doesn't go wild like Yngwie often does in his solos. Anyway, a real cool song. A couple other cool ones are ""Why"", which has a really cool main melody and solo, and ""Tears in the Rain"", which is a very moving acoustic ballad in A minor(harmonic minor for most of the song). ""New Blues"" has some cool tapping sections in it. Some songs you have to get used to though, which is not really a bad thing, as it will take longer to get tired of cause you'll be trying to grasp the full depth of the music!","Coolness.

1,I'll Be Spiritual,"""I'll Be"" is a fabulous love song, wonderfully giving in it's message of unconditional love. But there is also a very spiritual undertone that for me was very uplifting.

I skipped quite a bit in the final 2 books. I can understand why the publisher discontinued this book. Well-written, but disappointing.","All 4 books could have been written as 1 book.

0,Not quite what I expected,"I was quite excited to get this book, but when I looked through it I found that it was very wordy and not so big on substance as far as recipes go. Alot of fluff with not much in terms of recipes to try. I dont know- Im not an expert, I am just glad that I only paid 4 bucks for it.","Not quite what I expected.

1,satisfied,"I enjoyed the purchase I made; everything I expected it to be and more. The anniversary collection disc includes exclusive gifts inside pertaining to the movie. What made it even worth more was the fact that the Goblin album, which is the soundtrack for the movie is included. there is also a director's commentary I have no as of yet got a chance to watch.","satisfied.

1,Reality Within Fiction,"I'm not a very big fan of Tupac's music, but I absolutely love his poetry, especially after reading this book along with ""The Rose That Grew From Concrete."" I received this book for my birthday, and I finished it in less than three hours. The story seems so unlikely. The events that Angela Ardis decribed in it seemed so much like something that would happen in a fiction novel, but the way she describes the events, with Tupac's and her own poetry woven in between the chapters, along with the fact that this really, truly, did happen keep you hooked on it until the last page.","Reality Within Fiction.

1,spellbinding fiction in a badly bound package -,"As a work of literature it is hard to argue that this must be one of the greatest books of the 20th century. A classic ""good will always triumph over evil"" tale that is exceedingly well thought through.The plot might be a little tricky to follow for youngeer readers, ( tip: keep a note pad to remember who everyone is) but the story is spellbinding.I gave it four stars because although the literature is worth five plus, the quality of this boxed set is woefully inadequate. The bindings will not last the first read and the print is way to small for such a large work. Frankly it's a piece of junk and not worth the moneyI had hoped that this would be a special addition to my library but instead i will give it to my 14 year old daughter in the hope that she will read it before it disintegrates.I will keep looking for something of higher quality for my bookshelves.","spellbinding fiction in a badly bound package -.

0,Does nothing but dirty,"I got these at my local Petco store, figured I could use them when I went home for spring break. My mistake, these things are pieces of junk. I placed one in my bettas tank and it sunk watched and it did not appear to release any food. Plus it has plugged up two filter cartridges in just a matter of days. I do not recommend these.","Does nothing but dirty. I got these at my local Petco store, figured I could use them when I went home for spring break. My mistake, these things are pieces of junk.

0,Very disappointing,"I rushed to the video store yesterday to rent this as soon as it came out; I'd been really looking forward to seeing it, but decided to rent it first before buying it. I've been burned in the past. But how bad could it be? It's by Tim Burton, the guy who brought us ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the original Batman movie.I'm very glad I did.This movie comes nowhere near the genius of Nightmare; it's a tepid and insipid story that lacks energy, set to a totally forgettable score by Danny Elfman (another huge disappointment of this movie).The only memorable character in this piece is the Corpse Bride herself. The rest of the characters, especially Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) are yawn-inspiring.Where's Jack Skellington when you need him?","Very disappointing.

0,Makes me long for a wind up alarm clock.,"This device is too complicated. After you set the alarm, you have to remember that this is not the same as turning the alarm on, so you have to hit another button. You also have to remember that hitting the OFF/RESET button on the top of the clock just turns off the alarm for that day. The alarm will go off the next morning unless you hit another button. This is especially annoying when the alarm goes off at 6 AM on a Saturday. The nature sounds are repetitive and irritating with the possible exception of the ocean. The mechanism of the CD player is noisy, making it difficult to listen to low-level music to sleep by. While the display is backlit, the controls are not, so it's difficult to turn things on and off in the dark. I would not buy another one of these.","Makes me long for a wind up alarm clock..

1,Great Cam Love the thing,"I got one to ""play with"" around the house the monitor from my office. Love the thing! The most difficult part was poking the hole in my firewall (Linksys) but that was really simple too. I don't need sound or panning capability so this is great. Pics are fantastic. If it has a drawback it is that the zoom in the Java mode flickers but that would probably work out with some tinkering. I plan on putting in 3 or 4 more of these as security monitors and to observe the wildlife around the house during the day. See my pics I have posted.","Great Cam Love the thing.

1,Simply Amazing,"This is the best CD I own - I am not joking - out of 300 some odd CD's in my possession - this tops the list. I have waited a while for Jewel's new release and she has blown me away. You can listen to this CD all the way through and over and over again because every song is different and everysong is so beautiful. I highly recommend this CD to everyone - some highlights include - ""Everybody needs someone sometime"", ""till we run out of road"", ""serve the ego"" and ""the new wild west""- but the fact of the matter is - THIS CD ROCKS !!!!!","Simply Amazing.

1,"Good book, but....","First off, this is a good book for someone wanting to start off in OpenGL programming. It covers the basics, gives a very good outlook on conceptualization and 3D theory, and covers the basics of matrix algrebra. Everything you need to program a game is here without bogging the user down with the inner workings of openGL's algorithms.I have to knock off a star for the CD though. The DirectX SDK included refused to install on my system and the source code samples from the book were mysteriously absent. Fortunately, you can get the SDK from Microsoft for free and the source code is available from the publishers website, but it is quite a hassle. A few of the utility programs are also shareware and require registration, which is to be expected but still aggrivating.","Good book, but.....

1,Weezer's Best,"This album, in my opinion is Weezer's best. Rivers himself thinks it's horrible. The music in technicality isn't their best. In fact it is probably their worst. The songs though, you connect with them. They make you think of all your relationships and also the way you think about life. So if you're into technical songwriting this album isn't for you, but if you love fun songs with great lyrics then this album is right for you. I give ""Pinkerton"" five stars.","Weezer's Best.

0,Not very happy here,"Hey all -I'm not sure I get the positive reviews associated with this product. I guess it's not the worst thing I've ever bought but keep in mind a few things - FM reception seems very poor, in my area at least, compared to other radios. The buttons/switches are balky without a positive feel to them. Third, sound quality is mediocre in my opinion - granted it's a cheap plastic player, but man.... Last, if you're thinking about buying the accessory powered subwoofer (something that could potentially make a difference) - it's apparently no longer in production though it seemed to take AL customer service quite a while to figure that out. Overall, I'm not too thrilled. Probably won't pitch it in the trash, but maybe it'll go in the garage.","Not very happy here.

I recommend the power of two workbook instead.","Preaches Christanity and bad workbook design... more of the same - like the book..

The various art experts that appeared in the film went into great detail about the techniques used by Vermeer to obtain his wonderful lighting effects even showing, via infrared photography, that the artist had moved certain elements of the composition to make a more pleasing and focused work. A truly inspiring video. I can only hope that the other parts of this series come close to this level of detail.","Vermeer's Genius Revealed To All.

0,Where the legend began,"This book marks the first time Garfield ventured from the comic strips.Since this book was published, he has been featured in books, cartoons, movies, and countless tie-in toys and products.In this early outing, Garfield and Jon look quite a bit different from how they look today. Jon looks thin and anemic (even moreso than later), while Garfield looks fatter and uglier, like a grizzled old feline Walter Matthau. Odie looks basically the same.As the seminal edition, I would recommend this to anyone who likes their Garfield on the bookshelf rather than in the funnies.","Where the legend began.

Photos like people on the El, Vin Diesel, Crazy Legs, and newspaper outfits make me miss my childhood (minus Vin Diesel, although he's just great eye candy). A few photos seem plain or typical (ex. Treach's photos, the everfamous middle finger shot, and the soccer photos), some were enjoyable for no apparent reason (Spencer 97 Pro Skater, man on bike in South Bronx), and others were completely unique (Usher, Naomi 03 in Da Studio, Karlene & Cindy, ""Do Not"").
